Fresh Start Regional Operation    Introduction     Flint Lifelines and the City of Flint Police Department would like to propose Operation Fresh Start   This is a collaborative initiative with the purpose of assisting City of Flint residents  and the surrounding  suburbs who through various reasons  have found themselves in an untenable situation where they are  included in the population of individuals who have active arrest warrants     There are approximately 40 000 warrants countyviride and 23 000 in the City of the Flint  the majority of  warrants are misdemeanor warrants  victimless crimes  or civil infractions     The failure to address these violations has resulted in warrants being issued and driver responsibility     nes being levied  These warrants affect an individual   s ability to become employed and their ability to  seek employment and to provide    nancially for their families  Given these pressures  there is a high  probability that criminal conduct can occur     Purpose of Operation Fresh Start     Operation Fresh Start is a means to address and eliminate these barriers and provide a starting point for  individuals to improve their ability to become better citizens     Operation Fresh Start will include the following agencies as stakeholders     Flint Lifelines  Flint Police Department    58       District Court  67       District Court  Secretary of

12  Educational  13  Genesee County Landbanlc  14  Genesee County Sheriff Department    WSGWPWNT       Operation Fresh Start Implementation   Operation Fresh start will focus on individuals with misdemeanor warrants punishable by less than 90  days   less than a  500 00    ne     The operation will be based on targeting one  1  zip code at a time in the City of Flint County of  Genesee  on a speci   ed day  and partnering with a faith based institution as a base of operation within  the speci   ed zip code  This scenario will repeat itself until each zip code has hosted the operation     Persons within the zip code will come to the location and interact with the appropriate City  County or  State representatives to recall warrants  adjudicate civil in   actions  and settle    nes and fees and apply  for or receive a valid state license  Additionally  cormnunity service organizations will be present to  offer assistance if services are needed          The synergy of Lifelines and

City of Flint Police Department  Crime Reduction Strategy  Area Crime Team   A  C  T     The City of Flint Police Department is actively pursuing all relevant strategies in an effort to  truly address crime and criminal behavior at their root cause and locations  Gone are the days  of reactionary policing  we must be proactive in our approach  Identifying criminal trends  through analysis and addressing them head on is our focus under this initiative     The leadership of the City of Flint realizes that a complete law enforcement response relies  upon a combination of a true data driven approach and boots on the ground efforts  This type  of response shall allow for the realization of a true and sustainable reduction in all crimes  within the City of Flint  This reduction in crime shall allow for the recapturing of  neighborhoods by our concerned residents  the strengthening of community police partnerships  and raised awareness and unity towards the common goal of safer neighborhoods through  lasting crime reduction     The City of Flint is proposing to assemble and utilize an Area Crime Team  A C T    This  highly trained and specialized unit shall deploy resources into very speci   c locations to address  speci   c high crime targets  This can be exclusive to a singular target such as a known  homicide suspect or a speci   c target of general crimes and trends such as gang behavior or  other part one crimes elevated in data identified speci   c areas     This initiative shall hire additional police resources to acComplish this targeted offensive in a  collaborative effort  While the City of Flint shall be the lead agency and coordinator of this  program  we shall form partnerships under this initiative with the Michigan State Police  the  Genesee County Sheriff   s Department  the Michigan Department of Corrections and the  Genesee County Prosecutor   s of   ce  Each agency shall play a vital role towards our goal of  true crime reduction  Through the hiring of additional resources for each agency  we also shall  receive the ancillary bene   t of each agency and all of their existing resources when applicable   Leveraging these agencies shall also allow for follow up within the entire Genesee County area  when necessary through investigation and leads     We propose to hire one Flint Police Sergeant and three Flint Police Of   cers  two Michigan  State Police Troopers  one Genesee County Sheriff Deputy  one MDOC employee and one  Genesee County Deputy Prosecutor  This program will be operational for a three year period     We envision that this team of of   cers shall become a spearhead to address major offenders and  trends with signi   cant results  They shall work as a team and gain in   uence with the  community through their transparency and ability to work closely with community partners   This team shall have laser focus and target extremely speci   c crimes and locations based on  Flint Police gathered crime data as analyzed by the Michigan State Police  Once a crime or  area has been identi   ed  this unit shall saturate the determined area with a goal of total    disruption to the o   ending behavior  The of   cers shall perform the initial response   investigations and arrest of the perpetrators with the assistance of the MDOC resource  The  prosecuting attorney shall have oversight of all cases involving this unit to ensure vertical  prosecution  Additionally  a victim   s assistance program will facilitate victim services for  individuals victimized by crime in the targeted area

Intervention Strategy    The City Flint is in a very advantageous position to enhance our conununity engagement  program named Lifeline  this program is similar to the Cease Fire youth violence reduction  program model     This program model contains almost all of the elements of the Cease Fire model  and the  community   based research  networking and consensus building process this program model has  proved success   il in cities across the United States and in California  e g   Stockton  with  implementation also underway in Oakland and San Francisco  and consists of five  5  basic  elements       1  Crime data collection and analysis related to gun violence  iueluding the    geographic location of violent incidents  demographic information on individuals  involved in gun violence  and patterns of gang violence  The Flint Police Department and  has this data  but needs additional resources to analyze and present it in formats useful to staff  and the community     2  Organization of a working group to design and implement the local Strategy   Flint has already started doing this  and must expand its current efforts to include  employment training and placement providers  community and faith leaders and the  Genesee County Sheriff   s Department  we already have the other listed parties actively  engaged in the process      3  Direct communication with gang members and youth most likely to commit gun  violence  This element features community outreach and community meeting to  communicate directly to those most involved in youth violence  Meeting attendees are  given a two part message  a  gun violence must stop in nnediately or criminal justice  agencies will intervene quickly and tbrce   llly against those responsible  and b  the  working group is there to support the gang members and youth with intensive services  and employment  This phase will come once the program is implemented     4  Employment opportunities  Meaningful employment opportunities are provided to  gang members and youth participating in the program  with counseling  training and  educational resources and programs used to prepare the youth for successful  employment  Experience across the country shows that theuniverse of youth requiring  these services is expanding rapidly     5  Build a strategic law enforcement partnership  An effective strategic partnership  with local law enforcement  county law enforcement and county probation is essential  for long   term success  Law enforcement is encouraged to target resources to the small  group of youth who    drive    youth violence  providing not only gang suppression  but  also providing an incentive for youth to participate in gang diversion programs     Ancillsuy coordinating issues     Collaboration with other local agencies when needed  such as school districts  existing county  juvenile justice coordinating committees  law enforcement agencies  city police  county

Flint  Water Service Center  He has run countless tests on our drinking water to ensure its  safety for public use  Mike has not only conducted tests on water provided to us by  Detroit  but also on local water from nearby rivers  lakes and streams including the Flint  River  When asked if over the last decade if he has seen any abnormalities of major  concern in the water  his response was an emphatic     No   In his words     there has been  nothing seen that was of major concern     during his ongoing tenure working in the lab      The tests results have shown that our water is not only safe  but of the high quality that  Flint customers have come to expect   announced DPW Director Howard Croft     we are    proud of the end result      Apart from the water plants devotion to

hire a contractorto perform a leak  detection survey of the city water lines  The city will receive a map of leak locations and an  assessment of leak severity  allowing the city to prioritize leak repair  The project also  covers the expense of conducting a water pipe line wall thickness condition assessment on  a portion of the city   s pipes  The assessmentwill guide the city s water main replacement    program   The city also was awarded  1 1 million to shut down its current Water Pollution Control    Facility incinerator and replace it with new facilities which will allow for the disposal of  waste in landfills  The existing facilities are not up to federal Environmental Protection    Agency standards          Municipalities are eligible for the grants of they are experiencing

obligation to budget responsibly and that has led to a 2   year budget  proposal  The budgets for these two fiscal years are balanced  The City remains in a  budgetary crisis that impairs its ability to provide public safety and other city services   However  the city sees this as the beginning  not the end of this process     Over the next six months         The city will work to prevent an immediate disruption in public safety    reductions  are to be achieved by December 2014  not immediate lay offl  this will be a  managed process     V The City is unable to fully fund its Police and Fire Departments at current levels and  is unable to provide needed public safety services at current levels  A  Comprehensive Police and Fire Study will recommend the most efficient use ofthe  city s limited public safety resources        The city will continue working toward a resolution of the retiree health care lawsuit      this is a  5 million additional  and increasing  expense across all City funds        The Mayor and Emergency Manager will seek State support for increased revenue   opportunity for residents to vote on increased income tax rate  State assistance to  participate in a voluntary OPEB pool  and increased shared revenue       City will complete organizational restructuring to fully utilize City staff        City will engage our partner organizations throughout the city  county and state for  recommendations and support     Throughout the 2 year budget period the Michigan State Police have indicated that they will  continue their directed patrol and investigative support for public safety in Flint  This  support has been tremendously valuable to the City of Flint  The city will continue to work  together cooperatively and look for ways to enhance this relationship for the safety and  security of the residents and visitors     Beyond this budget period the City will still face significant financial challenges without  major revenue increases  The 2   year budget gives the City stability while it works to achieve  a long   term solution     1 Anticipated public safety layoffs are 19 fire and 36 police for a total public safety reduction of 55  Revenues  needed to prevent the public safety layoffs is ca   4 million     Snyder  Rick  GOV     From   Sent   To   Cc     Subject   Attachments     Governor     Agen  Jarrod  GOV     Wednesday

 CITY OF FLINT DRINKING WATER    What contributed to the Boil Water Advisories in the city of Flint     A number of factors  not one specific cause  likely contributed to the Boil Water  Advisories  BWAs  in the city of Flint during August and September 2014  While use of  the Flint River has increased the amount of natural organic matter in the city   s water  the  Flint Water Treatment Plant  WTP  has performed well above treatment requirements  for organic carbon removal  In addition  less than 20 percent of the water system was  included in the advisory area  If treatment had been compromised  detections would  have been widespread throughout the city  rather than in such a localized area     The city   s water distribution system has suffered from a lack of infrastructure investment  and asset management  Most of the city   s over 550 miles of water mains are now over  75 years old and constructed of cast iron piping  Cast iron pipe is subject to internal  corrosion  called tuberculation  which causes buildup on the pipe interior  leading to  water quality issues  reduced flow and pressures  and leakage  Tuberculation also  encourages the development of biofilms  layers of bacteria that attach to the interior  pipe wall  Biofilm growth is common in areas of piping with little or no disinfectant  residual  and together with tuberculation can clog water lines to the point of insufficient  water pressure     The city has also experienced decades of a declining user base and water use  associated with vacant homes  commercial businesses  and industrial property   Declining water use leads to excess residence time within the city   s distribution pipes  and water storage facilities  accelerating tuberculation  biofilm growth  and disinfectant  residual degradation  While the city has recently seen an infusion of funding for blight  removal  contractors completing this work have been improperly using fire hydrants   causing hydraulic disturbances that dislodged and suspended settled debris  which may  have contributed to the bacterial contamination     The winter of 2014 was also one of the coldest experienced by the water system  The  city  which historically has unaccounted water losses of over 30 percent  has seen even  greater losses since February 2014 due to an increase in cold weather   related water  main breaks and leaks  The city lacks a formal maintenance program for its over 7 250  valves  which would normally be used to limit impacts during break repairs  Two valves  on the transmission line used to supply the area of the BWAs were found to be closed  during the city   s investigation  causing longer residence time  reduced disinfectant  residual  reduced flow  and reduced pressure  One of these valves has remained  broken     Governor   s Office Briefing Paper  City of Flint Drinking Water  Page 2    The BWAs also occurred during the warmest and  for 2014  relatively wet periods of  August and September  Warm weather conditions are not only more conducive to  bacterial growth but also degrade the water   s disinfectant residual carried out from the  VVTP more quickly  Longer residence times  biofilms  and tuberculation also contribute  to disinfectant residual degradation  Warm wet weather conditions also allow water  contaminated with bacteria to pool around piping with leaks and breaks     Process for Issuance and Cancelation of a Boil Water Advisory    There are a number of conditions that can trigger BWAs  This includes the following       Bacteria Monitoring Detections   Loss of System Pressure    Bacteria Standards Violations   Water Main Breaks      Treatment System Failures     Other Interruptions in Service      Waterborne Disease Outbreaks    The Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  has developed a policy and procedure  regarding BWAs to help guide staff  provide consistency  and maintain public health  A  PDF of Policy and Procedure No  ODWMA   399 022 is being fonNarded with this briefing    paper    BWAs may be self   initiated by the water system  issued collaboratively in consultation  with the DEQ  or when necessary mandated by the DEQ  Requesting customers to boil  the water when bacterial contamination has occurred provides an added barrier of  public health protection     The BWAs that recently occurred in the city of Flint were associated with bacteria  monitoring detections and violations of bacteria standards  These advisories were  issued by the city of Flint collaboratively in consultation with the DEQ     Current regulations regarding monitoring and standards for bacteria in water distribution  systems were developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency  have been in  effect since 1990  and were incorporated into the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act   1976 PA 399  as amended  There are a variety of bacteria  parasites  and viruses that  can potentially cause health problems if humans ingest them in drinking water  Testing  water for each of these potential pathogens would be difficult and expensive  Instead   water systems test for total coliform and E  coli  Total coliform bacteria react to water  treatment in a manner similar to many pathogens  Therefore  the presence of total  coliform in drinking water indicates there may be a pathway for pathogens or other  contaminants to enter the system  The absence of total coliforms in the distribution  system minimizes the likelihood that pathogens are present  Eco i is itself a pathogen   and its detection would be direct evidence of a health risk     Governor   s Office Briefing Paper  City of Flint Drinking Water  Page 3    Once a BWA has been issued  time is needed to investigate potential causes and  implement corrective measures  The larger the water system  the more time this may  take  Once corrective measures have been taken  samples must be collected and  analyzed to confirm that bacteria are no longer present  Using the most common  analytical method  samples must be incubated for a period of 24 hours before results  can be obtained  In situations where the bacterial contamination has been confirmed   two consecutive rounds of safe samples collected at least 24 hours apart are normally  obtained before canceling a BWA  Adding each of these steps together  a normal  response period to cancel a BWA under these circumstances would be expected to take  at least 3 to 4 days     Recent History of the City of Flint Water System    Historically  the city of Flint had been a customer of the Detroit Water and Sewerage  Department  DWSD  while simultaneously maintaining the Flint WTP to provide  emergency backup service using the Flint River  The WTP performed quarterly test  operations to maintain readiness and was utilized twice in 2009  supplying water once  for 2 days and the other for 3 days     In April 2013 the city of Flint notified the DWSD that it would be terminating service in  the future and contracting for raw water service from the Karegnondi Water Authority   KWA   Work on the KWA pipeline from Lake Huron broke ground in June 2013 and is  expected to be completed with connection in late 2016     In August 2013 Rowe Professional Services Company completed an engineering  proposal for improvements to the Flint WTP that would allow continuous operation of  the WTP utilizing the Flint River in lieu of continuing service from the DWSD until  completion of the KWA pipeline  In March 2014 the city of Flint entered into a Consent  Agreement with the DEQ regarding the Flint WTP   s lime sludge facility  In April 2014  the DEQ issued a construction permit for improvements to the Flint WTP  On April 25   2014  the city of Flint began continuous operation of the WTP  using water from the Flint  River and discontinued the purchase of water from the DWSD     A BWA was issued for August 15 20  2014  for a portion of the city of Flint due to  localized detections of total coliform and Eco i bacteria  Another BWA was issued for  September 5 9  2014  due to localized detections of total coliform bacteria in the same  and adjacent portions of the city of Flint  The advisory covered an area of  approximately six square miles  The city of Flint has a total land area ofjust over    34 square miles     Governor   s Office Briefing Paper  City of Flint Drinking Water  Page 4    While many of the BWA contributing factors listed above require long term solutions  the  city has taken operational steps to limit the potential for a BWA to reoccur  The city has  increased flushing of water mains to limit residence time  maintain disinfectant residual   and help remove buildup and deposits within the piping  The city is boosting chlorine  disinfectant residual at locations in the distribution system as needed  The city  continues to investigate water leaks and water main breaks and the status and condition  of system valves     Prepared by  Stephen Busch  P

distressed public or  assisted housing and transform neighborhoods  U S  Housing and Urban Development  HUD  Secretary  luli  n  Castro announced seven new Choice Neighborhoods Planning Grant awards  including  500 000 to the City of  Flint  These awards will help grantees craft comprehensive  locally driven plans to revitalize and transform  distressed neighborhoods  Pan of the Obama Administration   s effort to build Ladders of Opportunity to the  middle class  HUD   s Choice Neighborhoods Initiative promotes a comprehensive approach to transforming  neighborhoods struggling to address the interconnected challenges of distressed housing  inadequate schools   poor health  high crime  and lack of capital     Secretary Castro made the announcement at the Louisville Metro Housing Authority  one of the  grantees that will use the funding to improve the Russell neighborhood in Louisville  Kentucky        These Choice Neighborhood grants will spark the creation of community plans for progress     said  Castro     We look forward to working with local leaders to breathe new life into struggling neighborhoods   transforming them into places where residents can    ourish and dreams can thrive         We are fortunate to have a phenomenal interagency federal partnership through the White House  Council on Strong Cities  Strong Communities  8C2  working in lockstcp with Flint to effectuate change in the  Atherton East and the South Saginaw Corridor  The Choice Neighborhood grant will help support ourjoint effons  and Transformation Plan   said Antonio R  Riley  HU D s Midwest Regional Administrator        Decades ago Flint made the mistake of putting its public housing in some of the most isolated pans of the city   and now we   re seeing the results 7 high crime  concentrated poverty  and limited economic opportunity  In just the past few  weeks  we   ve seen three murders at Atherton East  This grant gives us the opportunity to work hand in hand with the Flint  Housing Commission and residents to break the cycle and reconnect families to opportunity     said Mayor Dayne Walling     The City of Flint and the Flint Housing Commission are partnering to address the historic challenges  facing the Atheiton East public housing development and the surrounding community  The neighborhood  struggles with signi   cant crime  These challenges are magni   ed as the poverty rate is nearly 40 percent   Further  South Saginaw and the City are experiencing a declining population resulting in increased blight and  large tracts of vacant land     However  the South Saginaw Corridor also has key assets  The City has recently completed its first  master plan since 1960 and has identi   ed the South Saginaw Corridor as a priority area  Created in 2012  the  South Saginaw Task Force has been instrumental in identifying opportunities for improvement within the  community  The Choice Neighborhoods Transformation Plan will serve as a detailed extension of the recently  established City Master Plan  These efforts will build on the comprehensive work underway through the federal    Strong Cities  Strong Communities initiative 7 which aims to create new partnerships between federal agencies  and localities to spark economic development     Read local summaries of the grants announced todav     Choice Neighborhoods is HUD   s signature place based initiative and its vision builds on the work that  has been done by the Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative  an interagency partnership between HUD  the  Department of Education  the Department of Health and Human Services  the Department of Justice  and  Treasury  since 2009  Choice Neighborhoods also supports the Ladders of Opportunity plan  which will help  community partners rebuild neighborhoods  expand early learning opportunities  create pathways to jobs  and  strengthen families  Choice Neighborhoods is focused on three core goals       Housing  Replace distressed public and assisted housing with high quality mixed income housing that  is well managed and responsive to the needs of the surrounding neighborhood       People  Improve educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility for youth with services and  supports delivered directly to youth and their families       Neighborhood  Create the conditions necessary for public and private reinvestment in distressed  neighborhoods to offer the kinds of amenities and assets  including safety  good schools  and  commercial activity  that are impo   ant to families  choices about their community     HUD   S commitment to teamwork means local residents and leaders are leading the way in revitalizing  their communities  In order to develop a plan that meets the core goals of Choice neighborhoods  broad civic  engagement will be needed  Local leaders  residents  and stakeholders  such as public housing authorities   cities  schools  police  business owners  nonpro   ts  and private developers come together to create a plan that  transforms distressed HUD housing and addresses the challenges in the surrounding neighborhood  This  Transformation Plan is the guiding document for the revitalization of the public and or assisted housing units   while simultaneously directing the transformation of the surrounding neighborhood and positive outcomes for  families            HUD  s

of Flint water has been a high profile concern in recent weeks  with residents  complaining about the color  taste and smell of tap water since a switch to Flint River water as a  temporary source as a pipeline is built to Lake Huron as a water source starting in 2016     0 Residents have attended meetings with jugs of brownish water   0 U S  Kiidee has worked with labor and community groups to distribute bottled water          l Mayor Walling has issued a letter  included below  calling for state and federal assistance forthe  city  including forgiveness of some  20 million in debt through the Drinking Water Revolving  Loan Fund and calling for the governor to come to Flint personally     o Walling also submitted a guest column to the Flint Journal with similar requests     He said the loan forgiveness is needed for the city to upgrade  its water  treatment process   0 Governor and Mayor Walling had a telephone conversation on Friday  and the mayor  has pledged to work together on solutions     I Rep  Sheldon Neeley also has sent the governor a letter  saying that his constituents    are on the  verge of civil unrest        l The Department of Environmental Quality has been monitoring the water situation  with a  detailed backgrounder and talking points attached below     I The Treasury Department is announcing Tuesday that Flint is among the cities receiving a  combined  8 million the Financially Distressed Cities  Villages and Townships grant program   0 The announcement ofthe other grants will follow the Flint announcement     I The Flint grants are  1 1 million to allow the city to replace the functions of the  old incinerator with new water pollution control facility allowing for the disposal  of waste to landfills       The other is  900 000 to allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak  detection survey  which will lead to prioritizing repairs     0 A breakdown of the grants is included below     Treasury breakdown of Flint grants    Flint Incinerator  The grant project entails shutting down the current Water Pollution Control Facility  incinerator  due to the incinerator not being up to new EPA standards   In order to meet EPA standards   it would cost roughly  8 8M in upgrades to the current incinerator  The grant funding will allow them to  replace the functions of the old incinerator by constructing new facilities which will allow for the  disposal of waste to landfills     Budget Breakdown    Construction Contractor  1 050 000  Project Management  50 000  Total  1 100 000    Flint Leak Detection  The grant project will allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak detection  survey of the city water lines  The city will receive a map of leak locations and an assessment of leak  severity  This data will allow the city to prioritize leak repair  The project also covers the expense of  conducting a water pipe line wall thickness condition assessment on a portion ofthe city   s pipes  The  assessment will guide the city   s water main replacement program     Budget Breakdown    Project Planning  90 000  Mobilization of Crew to Site  27 000  Leak Detection   16  diameter  378 000         Leak Detection 16    diameter or    270 000    Pipe Condition Assessments  135 000  Total  900 000    DEQ backgrounder on Flint water    Following the formal approval of Flint into the KWA in 2012  DWSD sent Flint a letter saying their  contract was thereby terminated  by early 2013      Genesee County has been using DWSD water without a contract since May 2014  But Flint took the  letter to imply a water cutoff  and promptly turned to DEQ with a proposal to use the Flint River  their  historic backup system           This proposed shift was pitched primarily as a money saver  But it put the city in the business of water  production  where they historically had been in the business of water transmission  DEQ approved the  use ofthe river as a source  based on the treatment plant   s past performance as a standby facility and  the improvements we outlined prior to a switchover      Several municipalities around the state use surface water supplies  rivers   Blissfield near Monroe   Manistique  and Alma to name a few     The city completed the upgrades at the water plant the facility and DEQ approved it April 2014     There were some initial hiccups  Last summer  there were a couple of    boil water    notices issued  One  for a water test that showed e  call  one for a break in the water main     The challenge to using the Flint River as a source is that the condition ofthe water is variable and  changes with season and weather  it has substantially more organic matter than deep lake sources like  Lake Huron  This organic matter is mobilized by high water events  and warm weather also can account  for more organic material in the water     The treatment ofthe organic matter is done with chlorine  One might conclude that the continual  answer is just to use more chlorine to achieve water safety  However  at some point on the continuum   the chlorine and organic matter create TTHM     total trihalomethanes     as a byproduct  When the  standard forthose is exceeded over several consecutive quarters of testing  the supply is required by  law to issue public notice and submit an approved plan for addressing the situation     You   ll note that this regulatory approach means TTHM testing is done quarterly  That means people who  use the system are exposed to TTHM for several months before the public notice is required  It   s  because TTHM is a chronic health threat  Over the long term  measured in decades   continued  exposure can contribute to some known health problems  if this were an immediate health threat   customers would receive immediate notification to boil their water or not use it          Put in context  the EPA  which established the standard and the rule  estimates the existence of the  Ti HM standard prevents an estimated 280 bladder cancer cases each year out ofmore than 330  million people who use public water supplies around the country     it   s not    nothing   State and federal law requires quarterly testing for TTHM and that the public be  informed of it when the annual average offour quarters    worth of consecutive testing shows TTHM     levels exceeding 80 parts per billion  Flint   s results managed to exceed the annual average in three  quarters  and they must develop a plan to address it     But it   s not like an eminent threat to public health  Unlike an e  Coll or even total coliform bacteria  maximum contaminant level  which require immediate public notification and response and are part of  daily  hourly testing of public water supplies  TTHMs pose a public health concern with chronic  long     term exposure     It s clear the nature of the threat was communicated poorly  It   s also clear that folks in Flint are  concerned about other aspects of their water    taste  smell and color being among the top complaints     The Safe Drinking Water Act requires public water supplies be tested for more than 90 regulated  contaminants  including microbial contaminants  The act  and the program here In Michigan  work to  ensure that water is E to drink  The act does not regulate aesthetic values of water  Here are some  factors affecting the aesthetics of water in Flint     1  it   s the Flint River  The water supplied by DWSD historically came from Lake Huron  It   s softer   With hard water  you get a different flavor and feel  it   s why General Motors suspended use of  Flint Water    it was rusting their parts  Also  there   s the    organics  factor  discussed previously      2  The system is old  Flint has more than 500 miles ofwater pipes  More than half ofthese pipe  miles are more than 75 years old  Much of it Is cast iron  Hard water can react with cast iron and  exacerbates the rusty factor  which creates that brown water that angry residents were holding  up in jugs for the media cameras last week  Valve failure has also been a key challenge  The  system has an estimated 7 500  valves  When they stick open or stick shut  it affects the  hydraulics of the system and increase areas of stagnation  The city has a backlog of valves that  need to be addressed  They   ve done halfa dozen or so since November     3  Flint is old  Many of the homes served by the system are old  Brown water complaints may also  be attributable to cast Iron pipes in customers    service connection to the city lines  The DEQ has  been encouraging people with water coloration concerns to contact the city and see whether it  is the service line or the City s line causing the issue  Again  discoloration is not an indicator of  water quality orwater safety  but we recognize that nobody likes It     In summary  the City of Flint has tremendous need to address Its water delivery system  We are not  aware that they have any capital improvement funds for preventative maintenance in place  much less  line replacement project monies that will require hundreds of millions     The City was approved for a Revolving Fund loan in 2008 or 2009  As a Distressed Community  they  qualified for flexible terms and 2 percent interest rate Revolving Fund Loan  After they were notified  they were approved for the loan  they declined it  Previous SRF loans from the state to Flint hear an  outstanding balance of  20 7 million today     The DEQ continues working with the city to address the TTHM issue  They can take interim steps     from  scrubbing the Insides oftransmission lines to carefully monitoring the hydraulic challenges in their  system     to address customers    aesthetic concerns  Their TTHM numbers already are showing dramatic  Improvement  the Novembertesting showed only one ofseven sample points exceeding the standard     The key now is that the standard is an average of three quarters  worth of results  it will be some time  before they are officially    not in violation     However  depending on weather In 2015  it   s not  unforeseeable that we will be having this conversation again by next Christmas          The key to the conversation is that TTHM is not a top health concern  That s key because residents need  to understand TTHM in context  and it is key because it appears the mayor has seized on the public  panic  sparked  frankly  by their poor communication ofthe violation notice  to ask the state for loan  forgiveness and more money for their infrastructure improvement     Another key thing to remember is that once the city connects to the new KWA system in 2016  this issue  will fade in the rearview     Key messages     1  The DEQ Drinking Water program works with communities around the state to ensure that  municipalities provide customers with clean  safe drinking water     2  Municipal water supplies are tested rigorously and regularly for more than 90 regulated  contaminants  including microbial contaminants that pose an immediate public health concern     3  Flint   s exceedance of the TTHM standard should reassure residents that the testing program is  effective     4  TTHM is not an immediate health threat  it is a chronic concern  one that can be problematic  over the course of several decades of exposure  The public was notified because the law  requires the city to make public notification  so that everyone can make informed decisions  This  is particularly true for people with infants or those with compromised immune systems     5  The DEQ ls working with the City to address the situation  Recent tests show the TTHM numbers  dropping rapidly  The department will continue working with the city in the months ahead  and  residents should feel confident that their water ls safe to drink unless the DEQ or City notifies  them otherwise     6  The discoloration and odor issues some Flint residents are experiencing are separate issues from  the TTHM issue  TTHM ls odorless  colorless and measured in parts per billion     7  Flint water customers who have questions or concerns about theirwater should first contact the  city to get answers and help  They also can contact the Michigan DEQ     Mayor Wallingfs Facebook post    Friend     Access to clean  safe  affordable water is a basic human right     That   s why I just sent Gov  Snyder my Flint

Walling  City  Administrator Natasha Henderson  Finance Director Jody Lundquist  City Attorney Pete Bade  Assistant  City Attorney Tony Chubb    0 The City of Flint is involved in two lawsuits regarding water and sewer rates  Kincaid and Shears     o It was stressed that the Shears and Kincaid lawsuits are both separate but are being litigated  concurrently and that any developments mutually impact both suits       It was noted that in the opinion of the City  both cases will continue to be litigated for some time due  to the complexity of the issues involved       In a related matter  the City Attorney noted that the Water Coalition lawsuit to force the City to  purchase water from the City of Detroit was dismissed in Genesee County Circuit Court     Shears Lawsuit    I Shears was decided by the Genesee County Circuit Court by a non    nal order on August 17  2015     0 Among other things  the Court enjoined City of   cials from any longer imposing a 35 percent  increase in water and sewer rates      om disconnecting water or sewer service due to  delinquent bills  dating back to September 16  201 l  and from placing liens on property due  to delinquent bills  dating back to September 16  2011     0 City of   cials have    led an appeal with the Michigan Court of Appeals seeking  among other  things  a stay of the Genesee County Circuit Court injunction     o In the interim  City of   cials are complying with the Coult   s order in Shears       The City   s appeal is still being considered by the Conn  No timeline for a decision is known     Kincaid Lawsuit      Kincaid was decided by the Michigan Court of Appeals on June 11  2015     o The Court held that a 35 percent increase in water and sewer rates imposed by City of   cials  on September 16  2011  violated the City charter and that Emergency Manager Mike Brown  had no statutory authority to later ratify those rate increases in May of 2012     o The Court of Appeals remanded the case to Genesee County Circuit Court   0 City of   cials intended to appeal this decision to the Michigan Supreme Court  but missed the     ling deadline by one day     I The City Attomey stated that litigation of this case must continue because some key issues have yet  to be resolved  including     o The exact damages have not been clari   ed     o The issue of who has standing in this case remains unresolved          Summary  Conference Call with City of Flint  September 15  2015    Financial Impacts    City officials estimate that nulli   cation of the 35 percent increase in water and sewer rates is costing  approximately  600K month  Therefore  if the Court orders either refunds or credits against future  water and sewer bills retroactive to September 16  2011  the cost is estimated to be approximately   30M  _    o The Finance Director noted that since September 2011  the system has had a declining  number of users  so the total potential re   ind is higher than basing calculations from the  current number of users     0 The City Administrator stated that the City has not developed a plan to issue a refund of this  size because the City lacks suf   cient funds to do so and they would be unable to operate at  this point     The City Administrator noted that citizens are paying the latest monthly billing but that the City  must contend with lower revenues for the foreseeable future     In addition  it was noted that if the City has to refund the Ready to Serve charge from September  2011 through July 1  2015  that this amount is approximately  10M       It was noted that the amount of delinquent funds owed to the City that are over 30 days old has  grown from  7 8M to  8 4M since the ruling in the Shears Lawsuit     0 Further  the City Administrator stated that because the City is prohibited from shutting off  service for non   payment  the amount of delinquent funds is expected to continue to grow     In addition  the City Administrator noted that the measures taken to reserve funds within the system  to address the fmancial issues has delayed needed capital improvements  which further exacerbates  the problems within the system  but the City cannot address these capital needs without additional  revenue   The City Administrator further stressed the importance of the State assistance sought by the Mayor  in his September 14  2015  letter to the Governor   o The Mayor requested  3 OM for infrastructure and capital improvements related to the City   s  Water and sewer system   0 It was stressed by Treasury that existing funding options were very limited and we were not  aware of anything short of a legislative appropriation   I State funding of the City   s  30M request will likely invite requests from many other  communities with similar needs   I The State recently awarded the City  2M in Distressed Cities grant funds to  implement improvements to their system   I The State further provided the City with an additional  2M in relief for outstanding  SRF DWRF loans   I Treasury is not aware of any current Flint projects related to their water quality issues  that could be    mded through the DWRF program and DEQ is responsible for  managing DWRF eligible projects                 0riginal Message

attached    Lead Advisory  for residents to be aware of lead levels in  drinking water and issued suggestions from the Genesee County Health Department as to what  residents could do to reduce risk  These include          flushing cold water pipes by running water for approximately 5 minutes         using only water from the cold   water tap for drinking  cooking and making baby formula    installing a water filter that is NSF certified for lead removal     We worked with the Genesee County Health Department throughout the week to get them in a more  pro active mode to provide this guidance publicly and to encourage citizens to have the City test their  water ifthey were concerned about the quality ofwater at their home  The health department also    issued this fact sheet

provided by a Hurley hospital physician that  showed an increase in lead activity following the change in water supply  While we continue to review  this data  we have stated publicly that Hurley conducted their analysis in a much different way than we  do at the department  Hurley used two partial years of data  MDHHS looked at five comprehensive  years and saw no increase outside the normal seasonal increases  The Hurley review was also a much  smaller sample than MDHHS data as ours includes all hospital systems in Flint as well as outside    laboratories     We have also provide the attached data chart that outlines if the elevated blood lead levels were being  driven by a change in water  we would have seen the elevated levels remain high after the change in    water source     We have also communicated that for WlC beneficiaries in Flint with documentation of unsanitary water   they may be able to receive ready to feed formula and have encouraged families to contact WIC to see if  they are eligible for this formula  SNAP beneficiaries are able to purchase bottled water with their SNAP    funds          Talking polnts from MDHHS are attached as well     Thank you   G

Flint  Michigan     September 25  2015     The City of Flint is issuing a Lead Advisory for  residents to be aware of lead levels in drinking water after hearing concerns from the  medical community  While the City is in full compliance with the Federal Safe Drinking  Water Act  this information is being shared as part of a public awareness campaign to  ensure that everyone takes note that no level of lead is considered safe     The Genesee County Health Department has issued a fact sheet regarding lead  precautions for residents  The fact sheet can be found on their website at www gchd us   Here are a few of the suggestions the Health Department recommends       Flush your cold   water pipes by running the water for approximately 5 minutes    I Use only water from the cold water tap for drinking  cooking  and especially for    making baby formula     Install a water filter that is NSF certified for lead removal      Lead contamination can leach into water from a home   s lead water service lines  lead  solder  and leaded plumbing materials including fixtures  faucets  and    ttings  Older  service lines with pipes and fixtures installed before 1986 can sometimes be more  susceptible to lead issues due to materials used in the home such as lead based paint    and lead pipes     This message is meant as a precaution to residents and does not mean that all homes in    the Citv will experience the same issue  Residents with concerns about lead service lines  City Hall  1101 S  Saginaw Street   Flint  Michigan 48502  810   766   7346 FAX  810 766   7218 www cityof

Environmental Quality  and the U S  Environmental Protection  Agency to improve the water system throughout  the City  An accelerated plan to add a  corrosion control agent to our water within 30 to 60 days with expedited approval from the  Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is already underway  This will reduce    corrosion which can cause lead in old pipes to leach into the water     This plan is in addition to Mayor Walling s letter requesting  30 Million in water  infrastructure assistance funding from the State of Michigan   10 Million of that request  would be for the replacement of lead service lines in households to ensure that lead no  longer presents a danger to the drinking water of our residents  As the letter states   it is  the City   s position that the abatement of lead through the removal of lead containing pipes  and fixtures in homes is the best long term solution to keeping our residents    water safe      Mayor Walling further stated   I am extremely concerned about the risks around lead with  Flint   s children and i will be working tirelessly to ensure the water is safe and all of our    families have the information they need  i also will continue to pursue funding for  infrastructure improvements and a comprehensive healthy homes initiative that  addresses lead in paint and pipes  We have to get the lead out of our community to    eliminate the threat of childhood lead poisoning      The City of Flint continues working proactively with the County Health Department  the  Michigan Department of Environmental Quality  and the U S  Environmental Protection  Agency to improve the water system throughout the City  The City remains committed to  working with all of our partners in the Water Technical Advisory Committee to address

for every community  It is  completely unacceptable that respected scienti   c experts and our trusted local physicians have  veri   ed that the City of Flint   s drinking water is dangerous for our citizens  especially our most  vulnerable young people     As a result  I am formally requesting assistance as suggested by the experts on the     ontline of this  public health crisis  Here are the top priorities we should work together to address     1  Swift transfer to a safe source of water until the Karegnondi Water Authority   KWA  project is complete next year  Your administration has the ability to ensure a     nancially acceptable and responsible contract between Flint and the Detroit Water and  Sewerage Department  particularly in light of the public health implican ons with the Flint  River supply     2  Equally urgent is the need for corrosion control as recommended by independent  scienti   c experts  There are chemical treatment additives that could help reduce this  corrosion  I urge you to help the city implement anti corrosion methods immediately  The  current emergency makes the January timeline unacceptable     3  Filters and bottled water assistance  Flint water touches the entire city  Whether it   s a  person   s home  work  school  restaurant or place of worship  access to safe  clean  drinking water should not be hindered  Water    lters  used in conjunction with corrosion  control methods  are necessaly to help guard against toxic exposure     Ihave been working with the philanthropic community and private sector to secure  donations to acquire    lters and water  however  more funds will be necessary to  effectively cover the thousands of residents impacted  I would like to formally request  emergency fundng to help supplement the acquisition of water filters and bottled water   Any and all appropriate state or federal money to help accomplish this feat should be  considered     minim In iir ll                         SENATE

upcoming KWA  pipeline will solve a number of problems associated with the current sourcing of Flint   s  water from the Flint River  I am requesting a meeting between representatives from your  of   ce  KWA board members and project engineers to discuss any options to expedite the  pipeline   s construction          S  A long term commitment to addressing outdated infrastructure  A recent EPA report  just outlined the billions of dollars necessary over the next several decades to adequately  secure safe water for mu entire state  You have the position and opportunity to be a  national leader on moving the debate felward on this topic so that we can avoid the type  of catastrophe my community is grappling with today     I look forward to working with you to deliver on these concrete and urgent action items to  alleviate the public health crisis facing our residents     We jeopardize any progress and comeback for our cities and state if we cannot ensure safe  basic  necessities

  Health and Human Services  regularly monitors blood levels in children throughout  Michigan communities  The leading cause of lead poisoning is exposure to lead paint     Blood lead level testing results for the 12   month period just after the City of Flint  changed its water source  May 2014     April 2015  showed no significant change in the  pattern of blood lead levels in Flint  compared to the previous three years  This data  suggests the recent change In water source by the City of Flint has not contributed to an  increase in lead exposure throughout the community     How does the state decide if the water is creating a lead problem     Compliance with the federal lead rule is based on a 90 I percentile calculation  If more  than 10 percent of samples report lead above the federal action level of15 parts per  billion  a water supply has an    action level exceedance     An exceedance is not a  violation  lt triggers other requirements which could include public notification  additional  water quality sampling  and possibly further treatment     While some of Flint   s individual samples exceeded the 15 parts    per    billion lead action  level compliance  Is based on the 90 1 percentile of samples  The City of Flint s 90   h  percentile level has ranged between 0 parts per billion  In 2008 and 2011  and 15 parts  per billion in 1992  but never exceeded the action level     The two most recent sampling periods  in 2014 and 2015  were 6 parts per billion and  11 parts per billion  respectively     Did the city use gviry sample they got back     Sampling requirements for lead and copper are designed to target the most common  pathways to lead ingestion in homes with the least protection  The sample must be  collected from a commonly used kitchen or bathroom tap  and in accordance with the  provided sampling instructions  Homes that employ filtration or additional treatment  cannot be included  Samples must also be collected within the established monitoring  period     1 have a lead service connection or lead plumbing  Whatshould i do   Replacement is the only way to eliminate lead exposure  However  here are some  interim steps homeowners can take to reduce it     Flush pipes before drinking  and only use cold water for consumption     The more time water has been sitting in your home s pipes  the more lead it may  contain  When water in a particular faucet has not been used for six hours or longer    flush  cold water pipes by running the water until it becomes as cold as it will get  This  could take five to 30 seconds if there has been recent water use elsewhere in the home   such as showering or flushing toilets  Othenivise  it could take two minutes or longer     Use only water from the cold   water tap for drinking  cooking  and especially for making  baby formula  Hot water is likely to contain higher levels of lead     2    Who is responsible for replacement of leaded materials     Replacement of service pipes on private property and any leaded plumbing materials  within the home is a homeowner   s responsibility  The City of Flint owns the service  pipe from the water main to the curb stop valve  and that is the City 5 responsibility  This valve  Is normally located two feet  In from the street curb  From there to the house  is private property and the responsibility of the homeowner     Why doesn   t the city at least replace its portion of lead service lines     Partial lead service line replacement has been shown to mobilize more lead and make  the situation worse  Only full lead service line replacement has been demonstrated  effective in achieving long term reductions in drinking water lead levels     What is the City   s timeline for installation of corrosion control treatment     The federal government allows the steps to complete the installation of optimal  corrosion control treatment and follow   up monitoring to take up to five years     However  the City of Flint has committed to completing installation of Optimized  Coriosion Control Treatment in less than six months     What will happen when Flint joins the Karegnondi Water Authority next year   The City has committed to having Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment in place prior  to its connection with the Karegnondi Water Authority  KWA   The water provided by  KWA will come from a new source  Lake Huron  The city will continue its lead and  copper sampling every six months  Additionally  the city   s water treatment plant will  continue to operate with uninterrupted Optimized Corrosion Control Treatment     How long would it take to replace lead service lines throughout Flint     The city has about 32 900 service connections in total  More than 15 000 of these  connections are considered lead service lines  Even if many crews were contracted  it  would likely take up to 15 years to complete this work     What would it cost to replace the lead service line at my house   Average costs to replace a lead service line at an individual home range from  2 000 to   8 000  Costs vary depending on the length and size of service line that is needed  as      well as the ground cover and soil conditions encountered     With more than 15 000 lead service lines at an estimated average cost of  4 000 for  each replacement  total cost could be  60 million or more          Blood Lead Levels in Flint Talking Points  September 24  2015    Promoting the health of our residents is a statewide priority    a priority that includes  ensuring clean  safe drinking water for all residents and especially children     The results of the Hurley Children   s Hospital are under review by the Michigan  Department of Health and Human Services     The analysis that Hurley conducted is different from the way MDHHS has analyzed data  regarding blood lead levels in Flint     MDHHS is looking to see if we can replicate the results ofthe Hurley study to see how  they achieved their results     MDHHS Blood Lead Testing Results in Flint    MDDHS data shows a comprehensive look at the data since 2010  years before the  change in Flint   s water source occurred in April 2014     Each year shows a seasonal increase in childhood lead poisoning in the summer months   the highest seasonal increase of which occurred in 2010     if elevated blood lead levels were being driven by the change in water  we would expect  to see the elevated levels remain high after the change in water source  rather than  follow the seasonal pattern as they did by decreasing in the fall months     All data included in the MDHHS analysis were reported by laboratories directly to  MDHHS  in accordance with State Law     leferences In Analysis    MDHHS data provides a much more robust picture of the entire blood lead levels for the  Flint area  and specifically  accounts for data over the full course of the past five years         Looking at the past five years as a whole provides a much more accurate look at the  seasonal trends of lead in the area     Seasonal exposure is higher in the summer for a variety of reasons including children  playing outside in the soil  and when windows are open and lead paint ls more likely to  be in the air  This seasonal increase would be unrelated to the water system     Our data includes children from the entire city  including all medical facilities  rather  than Just Hurley  has a larger age group of children  and includes a much larger sample  size     The MDHHS analysis looks specifically at the first elevated blood lead level for each  child  which provides an accurate picture of when first exposure occurred          0 The Hurley data includes a smaller sample size  much more limited time period  January   September of 2013 and 2015 only   and a smaller age group of children     WIC Children    a In homes with infants on WIC  if the household has documentation from an official  source of unsanitary water supply issues  that family may be eligible to receive ready to     feed formula  Families should contact WIC to see if they are eligible     I Each household would have to be looked at on an Individual basis

Flint residents need to have access to safe  clean  water now and long into the  future  Gov  Rick Snyder said  announcing a comprehensive action plan created with state  federal  and city leaders to address concerns about drinking water               The water leaving Flint s drinking water system is safe to drink  but some families with lead  plumbing in their homes or service connections could experience higher levels of lead in the water  that comes out of their faucets     The action plan focuses on increasing water testing  offering additional precautions for families  with lead plumbing in their homes  and providing long term solutions to address the city   s water  infrastructure challenges  The plan was created at Snyder   s direction by the Michigan Departments  of Environmental Quality  DEQ  and Health and Human Services  DHHS   the U S  Environmental  Protection Agency  and the city of Flint      We are focused on helping ensure safe  cleanI accessible drinking water and addressing and  mitigating concerns and protecting public health   Snyder said     Today   s action plan builds upon  ongoing work with local  state and federal agencies and our partnership with city and community  leaders  Together  we are working to ensure that all Flint residents have accurate information and  know that help is available to address potential problems      The city and the state also are working together to gather more data to ensure the water that  leaves the treatment plant as well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe for all residents     The plan includes       Testing in Flint public schools immediately to ensure that drinking water is safe  with testing also    available at no cost to any other school in Flint     Offering free water testing to Flint residents to assure their drinking water is safe     Providing free water filters to residents     Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes     Accelerating corrosion controls in the

federal lawmakers to tap resources at all  levels of government to address concerns     State health experts said there has been an increase in elevated childhood blood lead levels in  some speci   c communities  initial analysis of MDHHS data found that blood lead levels of children  in Flint have followed an expected seasonal trend  While this analysis for Flint as a whole remains  true  a comprehensive and detailed review breaking clown data by ZIP codes with the city revealed  that MDHHS data is consistent with a study presented recently by Hurley Children   s Hospital        While we cannot conclusively say that the water source change is the sole cause of the increase   this analysis supports our efforts as we take active steps to reduce all potential lead exposures in  Flint     MDHHS Director Nick Lyon said     As part of this  we are working closely with our public and              private partners to provide Flint residents on MDHHS assistance programs with free water filters  and inform families about the steps they can take to reduce all lead exposures in their home        As a part of the action plan  National Sanitation Foundation certified water filters will be made  available to Flint residents through emergency state funds and coordinated efforts with local    community agencies and donors  information about how to obtain the filters will soon be available        This action plan offers concrete steps we will take in a local  state and federal partnership to  ensure all Flint residents have safe water to drink   DEQ Director Dan Wyant said     The DEQ will  work closely with the city to gatherfurther data to ensure the water that leaves Flint   s system as  well as the water that arrives in Flint homes is safe to drink        Additional

DID WE FIND     1  The results of the initial screening conducted overthe course of the last week are consistent with the last round of  community lead and copper testing     2  There were a total of 37 samples taken from 13 schools  of those 37 samples  4 exceeded the 15 ppb action level   There were 3 schools that had samples exceeding the action level  Eisenhower Elementary  which had two samples  exceeding 15 ppb   Brownell STEM Academy and Freeman Elementary each had one sample exceeding 15 PPB  The  sample from Freeman Academy was significantly higher than the other samples at 101 PPB     3  Looking at the data from a health based perspective  the data clearly demonstrates that more detailed sampling  needs to occur so that the various sources of lead contamination contained within each respective school s plumbing    can be identified and addressed   WHAT DOES THE DATA MEAN   1  The data underscores the need for a complete and thorough evaluation of the plumbing system within each school     2  We have developed a protocol for evaluating the plumbing systems and we will be working with schools to implement  these protocols and to assist them in determining a corrective action plan to address this issue     3  The State is identifying staff within DEQ  DHHS  LARA and Local County Health Departments to assist schools in  conducting evaluations of their plumbing systems     WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCOL   1  DEQ s protocols are based on similar work done in Michigan and In other States     2  Multiple samples from each tap used for cooking or drinking water will be collected at prescribed intervals to Identify  levels of lead and its likely source     3  Once an evaluation is complete  we will be able to assist each School in developing a comprehensive plan to address    issues on a site specific basis     HOW DO SCHOOLS RESPOND     1  Schools should continue protective measures that are currently In place until a complete study can be conducted at  each school  This includes the continued use of bottled water for consumption purposes     2  We will be reaching out to schools to schedule a complete evaluation  assessment and sampling  oftheir plumbing    systems     Drinking Water Regulations for Monitoring of Lead in Schools and Child Care Centers    There is no federal or Michigan law requiring sampling of drinking water In schools that receive water from other public  water systems  although schools that have their own water supply are subject to regulation and sampling as non  community public water systems  Schools served by a public watersystem may be included as a sampling site  i e   tap   for a public water system   s lead and copper monitoring program ifthere are insufficient single family homes that  qualify  There are no federal requirements for more extensive testing     The 1986 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act  SDWA  required EPA to develop regulations to control for lead in  drinking water  The Lead and Copper Rule  LCR   issued in 1991  is focused on controlling corrosion within the  distribution system that delivers water to customers  The 1986 SDWA Amendments also required that only lead   free  materials be used in new plumbing and in plumbing repairs     in 1988  the SDWA was further amended by the Lead Contamination Control Act  LCCA   to reduce the exposure of lead  to children in schools and child care facilities  The LCCA prohibited the sale ofany drinking water coolerthat is not lead   free and required that       the EPA identify each brand and model of drinking water cooler  indicating which are lead free and which have a lead    lined tank and distribute the list to states  SDWA Sec  1463        the Consumer Product Safety Commission order that manufacturers and importers of all drinking water coolers  identified as having a lead lined tank repair  replace  or recall and provide a refund for such coolers  SDWA Sec  1462      the EPA publish a guidance document and testing protocol to assist states in determining the source and degree of  lead contamination in school drinking water  SDWA Sec  1464   and      states establish programs to assist schools and child care facilities to test for and remedy lead contamination  problems  with public availability of results of such testing  SDWA Sec  1464 d       As a result of a 1996 court decision  States are not required to establish testing programs  In its decision  the Fifth Circuit  held that provisions in section 1464 d  were unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment to the U S  Constitution  because they directly compelled the state to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program and provided no options  for the State to decline the program  The decision did not  however  restrict states from developing and carrying out  their own programs to assist schools     in 1989 and subsequent years  EPA released guidance and information to inform states and school systems how to test  for and reduce the risk of lead exposure in school drinking water  EPA   s guidance provides a protocol for testing water  in schools and recommends that schools take action at fixtures where the lead concentration exceeds 20 ppb  This  concentration differs from the 15 ppb action level that publicwater systems are required to follow  The ZDppb action  level is based on a smallersample collection volume of 250 milliliters  ml  and is designed to pinpoint specific  fountains and outlets that require attention     in 1990  Michigan did provide schools and licensed child care centers with information to assist in testing and remedying  potential lead contamination of their drinking water as required by the Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988  This  information included a sampling protocol and guidance on flushing theirsystem to minimize lead exposure     in 2004  EPA surveyed states to determine what additional programs may exist to control exposure to lead in drinking  water at schools and child care centers  Forty   nine states  Puerto Rico  the District of Columbia and the Navajo Nation  responded  Only 16 respondents indicated they have orwill conduct special sampling or studies to target lead exposure  at schools and child care centers  Michigan has not included any additional sampling programs or studies  However   some local agencies have conducted voluntary programs  For example  the W l   Kellogg Foundation funded a program  implemented by the Calhoun County Health Department that sampled schools in Battle Creek  in Michigan s response  to this EPA survey  we included a recommendation for EPA to allow schools to be considered as a primary LCR  monitoring site so that more information about lead levels in schools would become available  However  no changes in  sampling criteria have occurred to date                         In 2005  a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the EPA  the Department of Education  the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   the American Water Works Association  the Association of Metropolitan Water  Agencies  the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators  the National Association of Water Companies and the  National Rural Water Association to facilitate actions that reduce children s exposure to lead from drinking water at    schools and child care facilities     Across the country and in Michigan  most schools and child care facilities receive water from other community water  systems  However  those schools that have their own source of drinking water are considered non transient non     community water systems and are subject to the LCR  in Michigan  there are 755 such schools and child care centers  that must monitor for lead to demonstrate compliance                    Response to Corrosion Control Questions      Lime Softening can affect the pH in water    The pH ofthe water is one physical characteristic that can affect the leaching of lead from pipes into    the water     As perthe requirements in the Lead Copper rule the Flint Water system was evaluated for Mo  consecutive monitoring periods and the results ofthe monitoring demonstrated that further action was  necessary       The DEQ promptly notified the Flint watersystem of the need for additional measures and the city of    Flint promptly began putting together an action plan to address this need

TO PURCHASE CAPACITY  FROM KAREGNONDI WATER AUTHORITY    BY THE MAYOR     The Karegnondi Water Authority  KWA  is a governmental consortium of cities and  counties in southeastern Michigan that was created to build a water pipeline that will provide  water from Lake Huron to interested communities in Sanilac  Lapeer  and Genesee counties   The incorporating bodies that created the KWA are Sanilac County  Lapeer County  Genesee  County  the City of Flint  and the City of Lapeer     The City of Flint is currently in a year to year contract with the City of Detroit for the  purchase of water  A study was conducted that projected that staying with Detroit will costlthe  region  2 1 billion over the next 25 years  In contrast  if the region builds its own pipeline  the  projected costs are  1 9 billion over the same period  After the initial 25 year period  the  projected costs would be less then 25  of the projected water costs from Detroit     In order to build the pipeline  the KWA needs commitment    om its members regarding  the capacity that each member will purchase in the pipeline  The KWA is allowed to Withdraw  85 million gallons of water per day  Capacity is available to members in increments of 1 million  gallons per day known as units  For each unit of capacity that a member purchases  the buyer  shall pay to the KWA a onetime fee of  32 300 00  Additionally  the buyer shall pay to the  KWA not less then  32 3 00 00 per unit per year until such time as water is made available to the  buyer  Alter water is made available  the buyer shall pay to the KWA an estimated amount not  to exceed  355 300 00 per unit per year until such time that the bonds are paid in full  If it is  determined that the costs per unit will exceed  355 300 00 the buyer has a right to cancel the  contract       The purchase of capacity along with the payment of other costs necessary to operate the  pipeline gives the member a right to water for sale to its customers  The buyer has a rlglt to  resell capacity and water rights  Each party entering into a capacity contract shall also be  entitled to appoint additional board members equal to the party   s percentage share of the total  capacity under contract     The City of Flint has decided that it is in its long term best interests to enter into a  contract with the KWA to purchase SIXTEEN  16  units of capacity  plus TWO  2  units from  the Flint River     IT IS RESOLVED that City of   cials are authorized to enter into a contract with KWA  to purchase SlXTEEN  16  units of capacity  plus TWO  2  units from the Flint River     IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Administrator is authorized to provide  KWA infonnation needed to administer the contract and  with approval of the Chief

City of Flint    APPROVED BY  CITY COUNCIL    MAR 252013         Response to Corrosion Control Questions        Lime Softening can affect the pH in water        The pH of the water is one physical characteristic that can affect the leachlng of lead from pipes into  the water i      As per the requirements in the Lead Copper rule the Flint Water system was evaluated for two  consecutive monitoring periods and the results ofthe monitoring demonstrated that further action was  necessary         The DEQ promptly notified the Flint watersystem ofthe need for additional measures and the city of  Flint promptly began putting together an action plan to address this need                         Drinking Water Regulations for Monitoring of Lead in Schools and Child Care Centers    There is no federal or Michigan law requiring sampling of drinking water in schools that receive water from  other public water systems  although schools that have their own water supply are subject to regulation and  sampling as non community public water systems  Schools served by a public water system may be included  as a sampling site  i e   tap  for a public water system s lead and copper monitoring program if there are  insufficient single   family homes that qualify  There are no federal requirements for more extensive testing     The 1986 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act  SDWA  required EPA to develop regulations to control  for lead in drinking water  The Lead and Copper Rule  LCR   issued in 1991  is focused on controlling  corrosion within the distribution system that delivers water to customers  The 1986 SDWA Amendments also  required that only lead free materials be used in new plumbing and in plumbing repairs     in 1988  the SDWA was further amended by the Lead Contamination Control Act  LCCA   to reduce the  exposure of lead to children in schools and child care facilities  The LCCA prohibited the sale of any drinking  water cooler that is not lead   free and required that       the EPA identify each brand and model of drinking water cooler  indicating which are lead free and which  have a lead lined tank and distribute the list to states  SDWA Sec  1463        the Consumer Product Safety Commission order that manufacturers and importers of all drinking water  coolers identified as having a lead lined tank repair  replace  or recall and provide a refund for such coolers   SDWA Sec  1462        the EPA publish a guidance document and testing protocol to assist states in determining the source and  degree of lead contamination in school drinking water  SDWA Sec  1464   and      states establish programs to assist schools and child care facilities to test for and remedy lead contamination  problems  with public availability of results of such testing  SDWA Sec  1464 d       As a result of a 1996 court decision  States are not required to establish testing programs  In its decision  the  Fifth Circuit held that provisions in section 1464 d  were unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment to the  U S  Constitution because they directly compelled the state to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program  and provided no options for the State to decline the program The decision did not  however  restrict states  from developing and carrying out their own programs to assist schools     in 1989 and subsequent years  EPA released guidance and information to inform states and school systems  how to test for and reduce the risk of lead exposure in school drinking water  EPA   s guidance provides a  protocol for testing water in schools and recommends that schools take action at fixtures where the lead  concentration exceeds 20 ppb  This concentration differs from the 15 ppb action level that public water  systems are required to follow  The 20 ppb action level is based on a smaller sample collection volume of  250 milliliters  ml  and is designed to pinpoint specific fountains and outlets that require attention     in 1990  Michigan did provide schools and licensed child care centers with information to assist in testing and  remedying potential lead contamination of their drinking water as required by the Lead Contamination Control  Act of 1988  This information included a sampling protocol and guidance on flushing their system to minimize  lead exposure     In 2004  EPA surveyed states to determine what additional programs may exist to control exposure to lead in  drinking water at schools and child care centers  Forty nine states  Puerto Rico  the District of Columbia and  the Navajo Nation responded  Only 16 respondents indicated they have or will conduct special sampling or  studies to target lead exposure at schools and child care centers  Michigan has not included any additional  sampling programs or studies  However  some local agencies have conducted voluntary programs  For  example  the WK  Kellogg Foundation funded a program implemented by the Calhoun County Health  Department that sampled schools in Battle Creek  In Michigan   s response to this EPA survey  we included a  recommendation for EPA to allow schools to be considered as a primary LCR monitoring site so that more  information about lead levels in schools would become available  However  no changes in sampling criteria  have occurred to date               in 2005  a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the EPA  the Department of Education  the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   the American Water Works Association  the Association of  Metropolitan Water Agencies  the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators  the National Association  of Water Companies and the National Rural Water Association to facilitate actions that reduce children   s  exposure to lead from drinking water at schools and child care facilities     Across the country and in Michigan  most schools and child care facilities receive water from other community  water systems  However  those schools that have their own source of drinking water are considered non     transient non community water systems and are subject to the LCR  in Michigan  there are 755 such schools  and child care centers that must monitor for lead to demonstrate compliance                         FLINT SCHOOL TESTING RESULTS   WHAT DID WE FIND     1  The results ofthe initial screening conducted over the course of the last week are consistent with the  last round of community lead and coppertesting     2  There were a total of 37 samples taken from 13 schools  Ofthose 37 samples  4 exceeded the 15 ppb  action level  There were 3 schools that had samples exceeding the action level  Eisenhower Elementary   which had two samples exceeding 15 ppb   Brownell STEMAcademy and Freeman Elementary each  had one sample exceeding 15 PPB  The sample from Freeman Academy was significantly higher than  the other samples at 101 PPB     3  Looking at the data from a health based perspective  the data clearly demonstrates that more  detailed sampling needs to occur so that the various sources of lead contamination contained within  each respective school   s plumbing can be identified and addressed     WHAT DOES THE DATA MEAN     1  The data underscores the need for a complete and thorough evaluation of the plumbing system  within each school     2  We have developed a protocol for evaluating the plumbing systems and we will be working with  schools to implement these protocols and to assist them in determining a corrective action plan to  address this issue     3  The State is identifying staff within DEQ  DHHS  LARA and Local County Health Departments to assist  schools in conducting evaluations oftheir plumbing systems     WHAT IS YOUR PROTOCOL   1  DEQ   s protocols are based on similar work clone in Michigan and in other States     2  Multiple samples from each tap used for cooking or drinking water will be collected at prescribed  intervals to identify levels of lead and its likely source     3  Once an evaluation is complete  we will be able to assist each School in developing a comprehensive  plan to address issues on a site speciflc basis          HOW DO SCHOOLS RESPOND     1  Schools should continue protective measures that are currently in place until a complete study can be  conducted at each school  This includes the continued use of bottled water for consumption purposes     2  We will be reaching out to schools to schedule a complete evaluation  assessment and sampling  of  their plumbing systems

Flint changed water sources  transitioning from Detroit   s system to the Flint River  This change created  water treatment challenges that have resulted in water quality violations  Aging cast iron pipe has compounded the  situation  leading to aesthetic issues including taste  odor and discoloration  Public Interest and scrutiny of the  drinking water system intensified following the distribution of required public notices of violation     The City of Flint has made a number of good decisions regarding treatment changes that have improved water  quality  However  this is a very complex water quality issue and the City is seeking additional advice on what to do to    ensure healthful drinking waier for the community     Veolia appreclaies the City   s decision to seek independent third parties to review current treatment processes   maintenance procedures and actions taken to date  and provide ideas for improvement  We are pleased to present  this iinal report to the City of Flint following our experts  160 hour assessment of the water treatment plant   distribution system  customer service and communications programs  and capital plans and annual budget     This report provides recommendations and a roadmap for improvement  though our engagement was limited In  scope  Our assessment included reviewing actions taken by the City to date  validating the City s plans going     onward  and making recommendations for ideas not being considered     Although a review of water quality records for the time period under our study indicates compliance with State and  Federal water quailiy regulations  Veoiia  as an operator and manager of comparable utilities  recommends a variety  of actions to address improvements in water quality and related aesthetics including  operational changes and  Improvements  changes in water treatment processes  procedures and chemical dosing  adjustments In how current  technologies are being used  increased maintenance and capital program activities  increased training  and  an    enhanced customer communications program     We are also providing a recommended schedule and estimated costs for implementing changes  it Is our desire to  help Flint residents and public of   cials better understand the current situation so that Informed decisions can be    made to ensure safe drinking water for the city   s customers          Water Quality Report  March 12  2015    Review of Actions Taken to Date    To address water quality issues  the city has made operational changes  sought help from the State  hired  engineering firm Lockwood  Andrews   Newnam  inc   LAN  to provide additional advice  and hired Veolie for an  assessment from a utility operator   s perspective  The City has also reached out to different specialty vendors   chemical suppliers  filter companies and tank aeration companies  for Information about products to help with the    TTHM issues  These are logical steps to take   Flint is not alone in dealing with TTHM problems  as many utilities across the country are facing this challenge  The  City appears to be following standard steps that many of those communities are taking to successiully correct the  problem   Although the primary focus of this review was based on solving the TTHM problem  the public has also expressed its  frustration over discolored and hard water  Those aesthetic issues have understandably increased the level of  concern about the safety of the water   The review of the water quality records during the time of Veolla s study shows the water to he in compliance with  State and Federal regulations  and  based on thosa standards  the water is considered to meet drinking water  requirements   The City has been proactive in its efforts to reach out to the medical community  to set up a phone number and  email address to receive complaints  to post State Water Quality reports  to provide the list of EPA required water  tests  and offer to test the water at customers    homes     From our review  these numerous efforts demonstrate how the city is trying to be transparent and responsive  beyond what many other communities might do in similar circumstances     Water Quality Report  March 12  2015    State Report    The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality  MDEQ  has requested speci   c actions be taken related to the  total trihalomethane  TTHM  issues  The February 2016 report from LAN  Operational Evaluation Report TTHM  Formation Concern  indicated apparent reasons for the elevated levels of TTHM in the distribution system  These  generally rotate to high Total Organic Carbon  TOG  in the water source  improperly operating equipment both in the  plant and the distribution system  ioss then opilmal plant TOC removal and old cast iron pipe in the distribution  system  Our assessment conilrms that these reasons are likely given our on slte laboratory testing and    analysis  as well as ouriirst   hand observations     Due to time constraints  LAN   s report to the Slate was submitted prior to Veolla   s final analysis and  recommendations  and contained a number of key initial and contingent steps the City should consider  Including     initial Actions    Hire a Third Party Water Quality Expert to Complete independent Audit  Obtain a THM Analyzer

Report  March 12  2015    Veoiia   s Recommendations    While many ofVeotla   s recommendations match the initial assessment provided by LAN  our approach  as an  operator and manager of comparable utilities  considers a more comprehensive solution  These improvements  include operational changes  differences in water treatment regimes and chemical dosing  increased maintenance     and increased training     Addition of Permanganate    The addition of a permanganate chemical will help reduce ozone demand as  well as chlorine demand  The reduction of ozone Is needed to help eliminate the possibility of violating the  bromale limit  The addition of the chemical will require state approval  submission of design documents for  approval  procurement of the equipment and installation  The State has indicated they will work with the    City on expediting review and approval of any requested changes  The required dosage of permanganate is  estimated to range from 0 5 mg L to  l 2 mg L with a corresponding price of  160 000 to  320 000 per year    Please note    The water in the rivar is dynamic which means it will change with weather  seasons and other  factors  The estimates provided are based on bench testing at a given time and as such require the  operators to test water and to verify chemical dosages on a frequent basis      Reduction of Ozone Feed     Treating water is a delicate balance   increasing ozone to fix the TTHM  problem can raise bromate levels to a point of violation  The introduction of permanganate is being  recommended to reduce the demand tor ozone so that feed rates will not exceed 5 mg L  The current  ozone dosing has been as high as 8 mgIL and  as such  it allowed to continue  will Increase the risk of    violating the bromate levels     increase of Ferric Chloride   Four coagulants were tested by Vaciia   ferric chloride  ferric sulfate   polyaluminum chloride tPACl  and aluminum chlorohydrate  ACH   Ferric chloride and ACH were found to  be the best choice of product for effectiveness in removing TOC  a precursor to TTHM formation  Current  ferric chloride dosages are too low and dosages of 100 mg L or more are recommended  Again  please  note  that the amount of chemical needed changes with the nature of the river and as such  water must be  tested multiple times a day with corresponding changes in chemical dosages  This increase to 100 rug L is  twice what is currently being fed and much higher than what had previously been fed last year  The  increase in chemical costs could be up to  1 000 000 per year  This change in dosage  using ferric  chloride  can be made immediately without state permit review     Reduction of Lime     Lime is currently being averted  A higher dosage of time does not necessarily mean  better treatment  A review of different dosages with jar testing indicates that the current dosage of 280 mgIL  can be reduced to 230 mg L  This represents a potential range of savings of up to  270 000 per year  This  change can be made immediately  it should be noted that the current softening equipment is in poor  condition  which does complicate the treatment process with a poor balance of flow between the two basins   walrs that are not level causing bypassing with the softener basins  and simply old mechanical equipment  that periodically breaks down  This equipment is not going to be needed when a change to take water  occurs  Addition of soda ash to help further reduce hardness in cold weather might require dosages up to  40 mgll  with an annual chemical cost up to  320 000  There have also been some questions or complaints  from the public regarding hard water  The water entering the plant is currently 360 mg L and the plant is  reducing that level of hardness to about 210 mgIL  Optimization of the dosage can reduce the hardness         Water Quality Report  March 12  2015         further to about 180 mg L  This reduction however has been sporadic as equipment breakdowns and high     ows have caused problems keeping the softening process on   ilne  As we have noted before  the dosage  needs to be adjusted daily or more often based on process control monitoring  The raw water hardness In  the summer is much less than in the winter  For Illustration purposes  the difference could be 360 mgIL in  raw water in winter compared with 220 mg Lin the summer     Eliminate Pro Chlorination on the Fitters     The reduction of pro chlorination on the    lters during the  summer months can help reduce TTHM formation  This action has to be considered carefully with  procedures documented and reviewed for engineering principles  As such  it will take time for the design  engineer to determine what could be done to assure the proper chlorine contact time and document that  other safety protocols in water are met  This requires state approval  Any submission should be considered  along with a possible change in filter media  If Granulated Activated Carbon  GAO  is installed then the pre     chiorlnation would be stopped or drastically reduced because of the chlorine impact on the GAO litter media   Veoila   s Initial investigation into changes in chlorine feed point Indicate that the recommended action can be  accomplished while maintaining the required regulatory contact time for disinfection     Change Fitters to Granulated Activated Carbon  GAO      The object of the other changes being made is  to reduce the TOC before chlorine is added into the process  The plant by design is limited on the amount  of TOO removal possible  A maximum removal of only 60  is likely it the plant is properly optimized  The  change of litter media to GAC would provide the best reduction possible and provide betterthan 90   removal dramatically reducing the potential for TTHM formation and thus ensuring compliance with that  parameter for the water system  The change In    lter media  however  is complicated requiring approval by  the state  design of the changes  procurement of the media and a contractor to install It  That will take time  and is likely in a range of  1 5 million  more or less  in cost  The use of GAG also requires more testing and  monitoring of the media and the TOC than with the current media  GAG will accumulate TOC and begin to  become in effective after a period of time  Depending upon the level of TOC reaching the filters this could  be as short as 3 months and as long as 9 months  The amount of T06 is dependent upon the river water  quality and operation of the other plant processes  Once the ability of the tillers to remove T00 is  diminished  the GAC media has to be replaced it riverwater continues as a source  The change to lake  water will not require TOC removal and the media could continue to be used as    lter media for that new    water source     Corrosion Control     The primary focus of this study was to assure compliance with the TTHM limits  That  is not the only problem facing the oily and Its customers though  Many people are frustrated and   naturaiiy  concerned by the discoloration of the water with what primarily appears to be iron from the old unlined cast  iron pipes  The water system could add a polyphosphate to the water as a way to minimize the amount of  discolored water  Polyphosphate addition will not make discolored water Issues go away  The system has  been experiencing a tremendous number olwater line breaks the last two winters  Just last week there  were more than 14 in one day  Any break  work on broken valves or hydrant flushing will change the    ow of  water and potentially cause temporary discoloration     Eliminate a Storage Tank   The water system has more storage than it requires  due to excess capacity in  the water lines in combination with the storage tanks  The City has already employed LAN to update the  hydraulic model  The hydraulic model should be used to help determine if water levels can be lowered  further and even to remove some storage tanks from service  That decision may need to be made         Water Quality Report  March 12  2015    seasonally  For example demand during water main breaks last week required extensive amounts of water   The excess storage is more a problem with TTHM formation for the system In summer than winter     Prioritize Valve Replacement    The hydraulic model shows long water age in portions of the system that  appear to be contributing to the TTHM problems  LAN has updated the model to include the location of  broken valves and that added information is being used to identify other system problems  The City has a  contract for valve turning and repair work that should be focused on known broken valves  particularly in  sections of the distribution system with old water age  This activity however must wait until warmer weather    in fear of causing problems in the water system with lines freezing     Target and increase Flushing     Flushing the fire hydrants can be useful in cleaning out lines to minimize  discolored water complaints and also helping reduce the age of water  This DOES NOT mean lust opening  hydrants  The hydraulic model needs to be used to determine which hydrants should be opened and for  how long to ensure the lines are properly cleaned  For example  this might require 15 minutes or even  several hours of flushing depending on location  The flushing of hydrants also needs to include records of  hydrant condition  color of water initially and after periodic increments plus chlorine residual testing  All of  that information will help provide information to the engineers on the effectiveness of the procedure  Each  crew doing the work should be trained to help explain the process to the public and also warn  neighborhoods about flushing so that staining of laundry can be avoided     Change to Lake Water   The changes being made now to thewater plant will not be the same changes  required to treat lake water once it becomes available  A thorough analysis and plan needs to be made in  preparation of that switch  This is going to need to include changes in how the plant is operated  like    eliminating lime softening and reducing the dosages of many chemicals  Consideration will also have to be  given to algae treatment when lake water is being used     Operating Programs   All of the changes discussed above are based on testing and techniques proposed  by engineers and skilled operators of both LAN and Vaolia  The staff will need funher training and  implementation of detailed protocols to successfully Implement the changes and to ensure long  term  success at the plant  This means the City needs to Implement a series of programs to ensure success in    these changes     0 Process Control Management Plan  PCMP      The amount of testing and resulting changes in  chemical dosages  along with monitoring the impact on the water  will require a welldocumenied  process that all operators follow  An example of this Is jar testing  which is used by the operators to  identify the most effective chemicals and dosages to optimize treatment  The staff understands the  basic treatment process but needs further practice and training to become pro   cient in the use of  routine process control to adjust iorwater quality  This is commonly referred to as a PCMP and is  used as a standard operating procedure so that the operators on the day shift can communicate  with the night shift  that operators are following the same treatment plan for water  that the  adjustments are uniiied between different shifts and different people  that a desired water treatment  quality is de   ned and variations from it signal alarms and that the staff knows what to do when the  water quality setpolnts begin to drift away from its desired quality levels     Lah QA QC     The operation of the water plant is dependent upon accurate lab results  Standard  operating procedure needs to be set and lab technicians trained in that process  EPA and the State    Water Quality Report    March 12  2015    set procedures and standards to be met and the staff should strive to meet those standards  The  City has already purchased a TTHM analyzer but should also consider a TOC analyzer that can be  an onllne continuous device to provide immediate information on inlluent and effluent levels of TOC   Part of the lab records should be historical review of data to help operators better understand the  changes they make in the plant     Maintenance Management   The key to water equipment ls having all the equipment effectively  maintained and functioning properly  The current capital program ls    xing many broken pieces of  equipment and updating the plant to current standards  This however must be followed with a  rigorous maintenance program that ensures the proper preventive maintenance  is able to predict  when maintenance is needed to keep equipment functioning properly and responsive to changes in  flows and source water quality     Training     The changes being suggested are new to the staff and as such training needs to be  prow   ded in what the changes involve  why they are being made  the impact on the water quality   and how best to run the plant  A good demonstration ofsklil level is for the staff to become certified  by the State as a licensed water plant operator  Many utilities now require all operators to hold at  least the minimum certification level as a starting point and offer incentives to increase their    codi   cation level     Communication Program        The city shoukl lay out an immediate  written strategy for communicating with  the public in the short term  as well as a  Ho 12 month strategy that contemplates known  future events like  the KWA pipeline and switch to lake water  A wide range of activities are underway to workwith the public  but a comprehensive and coordinated effort  with a strategic focus  will help the utility and its customers     Dedicated Communications Personnel     The City has a single  dedicated public information  officer  tasked with providing service to all of city government  The current focus on  communications support  or Public Works  and the anticipated needs over the next several years   indicate the city would benefit from the hiring of a staff person in Public Works who could establish a  communications program designed to provide clear and concise information to a broad audience  though a number of different channels  In the interim  the city could hire a communications intern   local communications    rm  or somebody with experience who is able to provide reduced or no cost  services for the immediate future     Communications Planning    Puhlic Notification    The City should be congratulated on its efforts  to keep the public informed  it is posting its monthly reports on the web page to provide  transparency  though these reports are highly technical   and may be too technical for the customer  base at large  They are valuable to those customers who do want this level of detail  The city should  create a single page dashboard of information that outlines the water utility   s performance for the  previous monthI post the dashboard on the website  print copies for distribution at customer service  or other reception areas  and be provided during speaking engagements or other events  This  dashboard should be easy to understand  and Include     o The number of water quality tests conducted the previous month    0 The number of violations reported              Water Quality Report    March 12  2015    o Whether these results are in or out of compliance    information about other proactive measures such as main and hydrant replacements  or  other programs to improve performance of the water utility    Benchmarking information so the reader has a greater understanding of how Flint compares  with other similar utilities In the region and across the country    Public Meetings     There should be additional  proactive coordination with neighborhood   community and civio groups to provide speakers on timely topics  Given the list of numerous  responsibilities  the Public Works director cannot do it alone     the city should identify three or four  other staff members  knowledgeable about the water utility who can also speak to various groups     provide information and answer questions  The development of an outreach strategy to target key  neighborhood  community and civic groups also will advance the communications effort and the    dissemination of information in both the short and long term    Standard tools     Work crews in the    eld are often the faces of the utility   the city should create  standardized tools for communicating with the public that can be easily and quickly delivered to the  community in the event of main breaks  flushing or pres planned capital improvements  Tools should    include     0 Door hangers for individual distribution    0 Yard signs with simple messaging to be placed near work sites  A simple tri foid brochure with useful information about the utility and appropriate contact  information     2 Specific ttyers about a range of topics  infographics about how the water system works  from the intake to the customers site    0    0  change in Billing Format     The city currently has no real way to reach all customers on a regular  basis and provide information  The city should consider changing from a billing postcard to using an  envelope and bill stuffer  Monthly or bimonthly bill inserts are typically used to provide educational  material for customers and are standard ways to provide information  Understandably  budget  considerations must be taken into account     Use Public Affairs Programming and Opportunities     The news media has been covering this  topic quite extensively     there are other media related opportunities that may reach a wider  audience  Taking advantage of these opportunities will help the city relay information to its  customers and the community     Panlcipaie in regular editorial board meetings to provide background information and  updates on key milestones or events     identify a local weekly television program and offer to provide guests to speak about key  milestones or upcoming events     0         Water Quality Report  March 12  2015         Conclusions and Next Steps    The focus of this report Is to help assure TTHM compliance and then improve general water quality  The City had  good results in its most recent TTHM tests  although that is to be expected wlth the changes made to date and the  cooler weather which contributes to low TTHM formation  Warm weatherwill be a different situation both in the  nature of the Flint River water quality and in the formation ofTTHM  With those changes coming  the City needs to  act quickly to make improvements before additional testing takes place this spring and summer  The summary  below provides the recommended actions  a priority for their implementation and projected costs either operational  or capital  The costs are rough orders of magnitude and will vary with changes in water quality  operational  decisions  and engineering choices being made and in some cases require State approval  Although a priority is  assigned many of these actions can take place simultaneously          Priority    Action    Annual  Operational  Cost    one Time  Capital  Cost         implement

 This activity has the longest time frame for design and  approval  but also is extremely critical to assuring reduced TTHM  production  The current filter cleaning and maintenance project needs  to be adjusted to take into consideration the change in filter media  both to dispose of the anthracite InStead oi cleaning and to Install the  GAC  This entire project needs to be done by eariy July to assure a     ow of water throughout the system  Several months are required for  the engineering design  State approval  bidding of work and  installation of GAG and as such needs to begin now      1 500 000         Contract with your engineer and initiate discussions with the State on  the addition of 0 6 to 1 2 mg L of either potassium permanganate  dry   or sodium permanganate  liquid   This

corrosion control chemical  This action can be  submitted and discussed with the state at the same time as the other  chemical and    lter changes saving time and effort  A target dosage of  0 5 mg L phosphate is suggested for improved corrosion control     35 50 000      50 000         Increase the ferric chloride dosage to 100 mg L depending on river  water TOO levels   Lower TOG levels can be

require Slate apmovai       50 000     1 00  000         Reduce the lime dosage to minimize hardness levels after softening   This will eliminate magnesium removal during treatment  but will also  reduce total hardness  A reduction in carbon dioxide dosing for  recarbonation treatment also is expected due to the reduction in lime  feed  This change can be made now and does not require State  approval       270 000          Con   rm with the engineer when the revised hydraulic model will be  completed and if necessary for time to focus on areas of longest water  age if that would speed up the effort  Identify Impact of reducing tank  levels or eliminating a tank seasonally to Improve water age  Include  with this effort a list of hydrants to flush along with time required to  assure drawing fresh Water through the system  The engineer has  been assigned this task already and confirmation of the timing of a  delivery is needed     Already  Contracted         Ask the engineer to identify closed valves on a map that are impacting  water age and that can be bid for replacement as soon as weather  permits  Have the engineer identify areas of the system where the  valve

education  using  envelopes instead of cards along with bill stuffers for education and  provide training for staff  Envelopes and bill siuffers are expensive  and might be done periodically and not every month  The cost of  TTHM notices  Annual Water Quality Reports and City notices should  be figured into If any additional costs would exist  Many of these         changes are underway now by the City          Position  Being  Budgeted              Notes      The costs provided are rough order ofniagnitutie which final engineering will firm up but will fluctuate with final decisions on

potassium  permanganate will likely not he needed  ferric will drop as much as it went up  ozone levels will be lower and little time will he needed                    10         Water Quality Report  March 12  2015         Results Expected    The real question is what changes can be expected from these results in lowering the TTHM  improving the  aesthetics and preparing for the change to lake water     TTHM  The City has already made great strides in reducing the TTHM levels with the changes already  made  The additional suggestions by Veolla will further reduce TTHM In the water and help get the city    released from the notices being provided to customers     Hardness    The hardness entering the plant this winter is 360 mg L with the current system reducing it to  210 mglL and

mglL to 150 mg L     Discoloreu Water     The discolored water is caused by the old unlined cast iron pipe  The water from the  plant can have an impact on discolored water  but a greater concern is the breaks and construction work  that disrupt the flow of water causing discoloration  A polyphospltate is suggested to help bind the old cast  iron pipe reducing instances of discolored water  This along with Improve llow ofwater and programmed  hydrant    ushing will help  BUT WiLL NOT eliminate discolored water occurrences     Change to Lake Water   The recommendations include the suggestion of programs to help the staff better  manage the treatment process  additional testing to adjust the plant and additional lab monitoring  a    maintenance program focused on keeping equipment properly functioning and more training for staifto  improve their skill level  Those actions will prepare the staff for the change of water sources when it comes  next year in addition to developing a thorough

Sent  Sunday  October 18  2015 3 54 PM  To  Agen  Jarrod  GOV   Clement  Elizabeth  GOV   Muchmore  Dennis  GOV     Cc  Wyant  Dan  DEQ   Wurfel  Sara  GOV   Murray  David  GOV   Subject  Detroit News Fllnt II    All     Brad   After reviewing the emails made available through FOIA  there are several things that seem to need    addressing   1  it appears DEQ staffers have essentially downplayed or ignored warning signs from EPA   s water    expert  Miguel Deltoral  We have been aware of Mr  Deltoral s unofficial memo that went public  in April  But his email dated two months earlier on Feb  27  to Jennifer Crooks and Mike Prysby     he seems to lay out exactly what   s come to pass           Particulate lead readings  Folks tend to discount these values as anomalies  but particulate lead  release is a normal part ofthe corrosion process and it is universal  common  in all systems  It sjust  that it   s not captured as often by the infrequent LCR sampling  If systems are pre flushing the tap  the night before collecting LCR compliance samples  MDEQ  still provides these instructions to  public water systems  this clears particulate lead out of the plumbing and biases the results low by  eliminating the highest lead values  lfsystems are ore flushing and still finding particulate lead  the  amount of particulate lead in the system can be higherthan what is being detected using these       pro flushed  first draw samples    My point on that was that people are exposed to the particulate lead on a daily basis  but the    particulate lead is being flushed away before collecting compliance samples which provides false    assurance to residents about the true lead levels in the water        Miguel goes on to address the optimal corrosion control situation in that same Feb 27 email        lfl remember correctly  Detroit is feeding  phosphate  for the lead copper rule  but since Flint  is no longer part of that interconnection  l was wondering what their OCCT was  They are  required to have OCCT in place which is why i was asking what they were using      So what I   m seeing here is Miguel having raised these issues as far back as February  When  unofficial April memo shows up  it   s clear these issues still haven t been addressed     Another email from the day before came from Jennifer Crooks at EPA which also highlights early    concern about a lack of proper corrosion controls as well as the testing methods      The City can   t just flush in advance oftaking the compliance samples  they have to    ush the    lines on a regular basis      Can you respond to the fact that it appears the state ignored or disregarded several warnings    from EPA officials about testing deficiencies and insufficient corrosion controls     Emails offer snapshots of a much broader conversation  The program staff did not ignore the  information  They believed they were handling the situation in full accordance with federal  protocols  and contacted EPA Region 5 officials promptly to seek guidance  They were more    than halfway done with compliance sampling under the federal protocol and the 90   percentile    samples to that point showed 6 ple    barely in excess ofthe 5 pbb threshold     Corrosion control  or the lack thereof  seems to be another major problem here  At the first of  the recent press conferences  Dan Wyant said that lime was being used as a corrosion control  method  But that is clearly contradicted by DEQ staff at several points  One of those is Pat    Cook s email from April 24      Flint is currently not practicing corrosion control treatment at the  water treatment plant      This puts Dan   s comments about the lime into question   There   s been some confusion on this point  and I think it was addressed in our previous  response  This was a misunderstanding with technical staff  Lime was added to soften the water     While it adjusts pH and can have some impact on corroslvity  it was insufficient corrosion    2     control     i gather from several exchanges in here that EPA and DEQ disagree over that the state   s  responsibility was in ensuring there was optimal corrosion control  One of the emails from July  includes notes from a meeting of all the parties shows that EPA was asking why that hadn   t been    used from the outset  and the state s response was something along these lines       MDEQ explained that they did not treat the switch to Flint River water as a    new system   but  as a new source  it is their understanding that two rounds of 6 month testing is still needed to  characterize the water quality  They don   t know what optimized is until those two rounds ofsix month    monitoring are completed        Under the lead copper rule  was the state required to haile phosphate treatment in place  It appears  here that the state chose to interpret the CLR as not requiring corrosion control  That seems like a highly  dubious conclusion     And after concerns were raised repeatedly beginning  at least as early as February   why was nothing  done     What has become clear in recent weeks is that staff believed they were handling the situation in  accordance with the proper protocol for a water provider using a new source  but the federal Lead and  Copper rule has a particular provision for communities over 50 000 people  that the system operator  must continue treating with full corrosion control even as they test the water     What the staff did would have been the proper protocol fora community under50 000 people  None of  the DEQ staff in this division had ever worked on a water source switch for a community over 50 000  people     it   s uncommon for our big communities to switch sources     it   s increasingly clear there was confusion here  but it also is increasingly clear that DEQ staff believed  they were using the proper federal protocol and they were not     The Governor will soon announce an independent  third party  after   action review to detail what  happened and why  and offer steps to make sure Michigan   s drinking water program is on a better  course in the future     4  Another area of concern  one I mentioned on the phone  is the pace of response  And I  understand that the lead copper rule lays out response times  But you have concerns being    raised about lead by an EPA expert as far back as February  The state   s response  in several  instances  is that federal guidelines give us two six month periods to collect samples  and then  more time to submit an action plan  and then a year or more to enact that plan     While those delays in making a change may be permitted under the law  given that we   re talking  about a possible public health crisis  why wasn   t there more expediency  The responses in these  emails appear to be without any sense of urgency at a time when Flint residents may have been  drinking dangerous water     The results of two rounds of water testing showed the city needed to move to optimizing its  corrosion control  That order was issued Aug  17     At many points along the way  serious concerns are made about the state s testing methods   The Virginia Tech results were not the first time someone had indicated state testing   as  approved by federal guidelines     might not be giving accurate readings   Miguel s April memo reads     I wanted to follow up on this because Flint has essentially  not been using any corrosion control treatment since April 30  2014 and they have  lead  service lines   Given the very high lead levels found at one home and the pre flushing  happening in Flint  I   m worried that the whole town may have much higher lead levels  than the compliance results indicated  since they are using ore flushing ahead oftheir    compliance sampling        There is substantial controversy over the lead and copper rule  the EPA has been working for years on  ways to update it  and Michigan will be an active part of that conversation going forward  The situation  in Flint is a snapshot of an issue affecting cities around the state and the nation  More than a dozen  states use the sampling protocol Michigan uses      that   s not a defense of the protocol  but rather an  Indication that even experts on the issue disagree about the most effective testing methods     What everyone can agree on is that lead is a serious issue  And I think everyone can agree that when the  state came to recognize that there could be a health threat in the city  we took appropriate action  We  are now engaged in an unprecedented effort to protect kids and families In Flint  develop more  knowledge about what has happened and how people were affected  and take steps to make sure it  doesn   t happen again     in Michigan  or anywhere else     All the people who brought this issue forward deserve credit for bringing it to us  Our actions reflected  inexperience  and our public response to criticism was the wrong tone early in this conversation  But the  best we can do with the situation going forward is represented in our present course    the Governor s  plan represents all the suggestions outlined in the draft EPA memo  the Virginia Tech report  and the    guidance we   ve gotten from EPA   We will learn from this  We will make necessary changes to see to it that our program becomes a  national leader in protection     Need your review of this document  It   s our response to Detroit News story they re prepping for    tomorrow     Per Sara  Dan will call Jarrod shortly to discuss what we   re proposing to do here     Thanks   b

Flint    As part of Gov  Rick Snyder s action plan for Flint drinking water  the DEQ today released water testing data  from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling results from Freeman    Elementary School   Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even individual faucets   rather than system wide issues        The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes  businesses  schools and other  buildings in Flint   said George Krisztian  the DEQ   s Flint Action Plan Coordinator   Problems with lead  exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing fixtures  and we want to see all families    in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the state    1    Freeman Elementaly testing results  At Freeman Elementary  31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each  Twenty two outlets did    not show elevated lead exposure  but nine faucets came back with initially high results     Those nine outlets involve brass components  indicating the problem involves the fixtures or plumbing  immediately surrounding the fixture  When the faucets and fountains were operated for several minutes  lead    levels fell significantly  in some cases to non detectable levels     Additional testing designed to look deep into the school   s plumbing did not suggest larger  systemic issues     Freeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and fountains  The  school can elect not to use those particular fountains  or implement a formalized flushing regimen  The  sampling results indicate that for all but one tap  a 3    to 4   minute flushing period each morning would    drastically reduce lead exposure     For a permanent solution  the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern        The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools  so we will start  work as soon as possible to replace faucets  aerators and other related components where high lead levels  were detected     FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawwab said   Once those fixes have been made  the DEQ has  offered to provide additional testing of the water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every  sample is safe for our students  Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ  working with all  stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe  clean    drinking water    For Freeman Elementary   s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling was    conducted  visit www michigangov    lntwater     The DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools  and results will soon be  available on the DEQ s website  Additionally  the state will test every other school in the Flint Community  Schools district  as well as any school or daycare in the city  Interested schools and daycare centers should    contact George Krisztian at krisztiang mlchigan gov     Homeowner and other customer requested testing results  Results from the 381 samples from homes  businesses  schools and other facilities that took advantage of free    water testing through the state showed similar  localized results  More than 75 percent of the samples  analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less  and more than 91 percent demonstrated lead    results of 15 parts per billion or less     This data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead service lines or  in  home plumbing  many other homes experience little to no lead  This can make it dif   cult for homeowners    and businesses to predict their lead exposure    Since it   s not easy to predict if an individual home   s water is at risk for lead  the best thing all residents can do  is get their water tested   Krisztian said   It   s a free test that provides valuable information for families        Testing is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 81048743537 and pressing 1  or by emailing    flintwater cityofflint com     For more information about water samples received through the state s free testing program  visit  www michigangov flintwater     How school sampling was conducted  To conduct this comprehensive sampling  the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory    Affairs began on Oct  23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain a comprehensive  2    understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing materials are used  The  assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the school that provide water for drinking  cooking and or    food preparation     On Oct  24  the DEQ and DLARA took four  125   milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified faucets and  fountains  The first two samples were taken immediately afterturnlng on the faucet  followed by a 30  second  flush and then the third sample  followed by a 2 minute flush and then the fourth sample  These samples  provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or around each specific faucet and fountain as well  as its connecting plumbing     On Oct  31  the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples  10 each from three sites in the school  These  1 Iiter samples were taken consecutively  and provided information about the impact of any lead sources deep    in the building   s plumbing                    Talking Points on Freeman Announcement    Q  How do we describe the home tests     A  The home tests are a surveillance   level screening tool  It is the same  test used by the state to comply with the federal Lead and Copper Rule     Q  SO  a safe reading doesn   t mean my water is safe     A  A low reading means there are no fixture related issues  This screening  may not catch impacts of a lead service line to the home  if a homeowner  isn   t sure whether they have a lead service line  the best way for  homeowners to be absolutely sure is to have a certi   ed plumber inspect    their home   Q  Does home plumbing inspection mean they dig up my yard     A  Usually  no  A good plumber can usually assess the service line from the  point of entry to the home     Q  Was the inspection of the schools done with a different kind of  testing  if so  how so     A  Yes  the testing at the schools is a very thorough protocol designed to  first determine if there are fixture   specific issues  then look deeper into the    system to identify possible lead plumbing issues   Q  What was learned by the testing at Freeman Elementary     A  We identified 9 of 31 sites where the plumbing clearly was imparting    lead into water  lmportantly  we did repeated draws of the water at these  spots over several minutes  and saw lead levels drop dramatically  This  means the lead is in the fixtures  not in the water lines  it means the fixtures  need to be addressed in some way     flushing for several minutes will help   but replacement of these fixtures offers a more permanent solution  And it  means the water at Freeman is safe at 22 of the 31 sites inspected  which    is of some reassurance to school officials     Q  The City is now using water from Detroit  When will the water be  free from lead again     A  The water from Detroit is treated with phosphates  which coat the insides  of lead home service lines and will reduce lead impacts  The City also will  be adding additional phosphates to develop this coating more quickly  but it  could take months for corrosion control to be achieved throughout the  system  it is important to note that  even in systems where optimal  corrosion control exists  lead components in home plumbing can still cause  lead exposure  Removing lead from home plumbing is the only permanent  solution to address lead in home water supplies  And testing is the best  way to get an accurate sense of one   s exposure  In Flint  blood testing for  children is free  and surveillance testing of water for any resident also is    free                         Deaf  Michigan

to 963 children and adults between  October 1 and October 30  Eighteen people ago 17 or younger had elevated blood lead levels  Six  adults over the age 18 were identi   ed with elevated blood lead levels     The report is intended to inform residents about blood lead level testing efforts in Flint and  provide cumulative total numbers        Our goal is to help families reduce their exposure to lead sources     said Dr  Eden Wells  chief      medical executive with the MDHHS     We have made progress in testing and identifying those  with elevated blood lead levels  and the department will continue to work closely with cormty  health department to reach these families  We will update these numbers on a regular basis and  remain diligent in our ongoing outreach and education        The data in the report include the total number of tests conducted and the total number of  elevated blood lead levels greater than 5 micrograms per deciliter  and captures both capillary  and venous

Flint  January 1  2013 through April 14  2014   to  the 17 months after the switch  April 15  2014 through September 30  2015   and  after the lead exposure prevention campaign was initiated by the State in Flint  October 1  2015 to October 30  2015  These numbers will continue to be  updated     The report also breaks down the number oftests and elevated blood lead levels  by children younger than 6  children ages 61   and adults 18 years and older     I Lead exposure for children younger than 6 is of particular concern    because they are more sensitive to the effects of lead and tend to absorb  more than older children and adults     Data in the report includes both capillary and venous blood tests  People who have had  multiple tests are counted only once   953 people were tested in Flint between October 1  2015  and October 30  2015  18    children 17 years of age or younger had elevated blood lead levels  Six adults over the  age of 18 were identified with elevated blood lead levels during this time as well     With these testing results  MDHHS is working closely with the Genesee County Health  Department to conduct case management to ensure that these families are receiving  the follow up care they need   including additional blood testing and a home    investigation to identify and help reduce the potential for additional lead exposure in    their environment     n    In addition to this report  MDHHS has zip code level data available by quarter for 48503   48507 by request  Zip codes 48501   48502 do have some cases  but the numbers are too    small to release by quarter     Water Filters and Replacement Filters    Our first action item is to work closely with our public and private partners to provide  water filters to Fllnt residents and MDHHS clients     To meet this priority  the governor identified one million dollars in state funding to  purchase water filters for Flint residents     The Brita SAFF   lOO filters being distributed by the department and GCCARD do meet the  NSF ANSI 53 standards for drinking water treatment units     The Brita faucet filtration system we are distributing are National Sanitation Foundation  certified to reduce lead in drinking water     Free water filters and replacement cartridges are available to current Michigan  Department of Health and Human Services clients and Flint residents who are on the    Flint water system at four locations     0 Flint residents who are not current MDHHS clients should visit one oftwo  Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices to obtain a    filter   I at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint  0 Current MDHHS clients in the city of Flint should visit their local MDHHS office       At 125 E  Union St  or 4809 Clio Road    Staff will be onsite at all four locations from 9 am  to 4 p m   Monday through Friday  to  distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation     Given the questions and concerns regarding the change In water source in Flint  MDHHS  authorized the use of emergency services funding to provide water filters for MDHHS  clients receiving assistance in the cityof Flint     This funding will support active Family Independence Program  FIP   Food Assistance  Program  FAP   Child Development and Care  CDC   State Disability Assistance  SDA    State Disability Assistance  SDA   or Social Security Insurance  SSI  recipients so that they  can obtain filters that are National Sanitation Foundation  NSF  certified to remove lead  and ANSI Standard 53   MDHHS has also posted an

have    followed an expected seasonal trend  due to small numbers further analysis was  initiated     While this analysis of blood lead levels in Flint as a whole remains true  after a  comprehensive and detailed review down to the zip code level  we have found that the    state analysis is consistent with that presented by Hurley   Director Lyon is working closely with DEQ and the administration to take active steps to  reduce all potential lead exposures in Flint and across the state     Our Chief Medical Executive has been in communication with the lead investigator at  Hurley Children   s Hospital  and we continue to work with Hurley  the city of Flint  local  and state leaders to verify and analyze data trends     Zip code level data does show that there has been an increase in elevated childhood  blood lead levels in specific communities     0 This does not conclusively mean that the water source change is the sole cause  ofthe increase  but data does show an association       There is an increased proportion of children with elevated blood levels in several    0  zip codes  particularly 03 and 04  These appear to have increased over the last    1 5 years   Lead exposure can occur from a number of different sources  such as paint   gasoline  solder  and consumer products  and through different pathways  such  as air  food  water  dust  and soil      Although there are several exposure sources  lead   based paint is still the most  widespread and dangerous high   dose source of lead exposure for young children  in the US and Michigan     We reviewed MDHHS statewide data using the same methodology used by Hurley   looking at our numbers by zip code and age ranges  and filtering out non   Flint children        Routine surveillance of blood lead levels does not analyze data down to the zip code  level  Detailed analysis like this occurs when there is reason to focus in on precise    locations or populations   MDHHS is working closely with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality   Hurley Children s Hospital  the Genesee County Health Department  and community    organizations to initiate further action steps     We understand that cost may be a barrier to following the recommendations for  drinking water  which is why NSF certi   ed filters are being distributed to residents on    the Flint water system free of charge     MDHHS is recommending that residents follow the Public Health Advisory issued by the  Genesee County Health Department  as well as take further steps to reduce exposures    to all forms of lead in and around their homes     MDHHS Stats and Facts  0    High Risk    Zip codes  48503 and 48504     0 Blood lead level rates among children under six years of age in the high risk zip  codes  48503  48504  were 2 7 times higher than the rest of Genesee County  before the switch to Flint River Water     0 After the switch to Flint River Water  rates in the high risk Zip codes were 3 2  times that ofthe rest of Genesee County     I Other Zip codes in Flint  0 Rates of elevated blood lead levels among children under six years of age in  other parts of the city of Flint were 2 times that ofthe rest of Genesee County    before the switch to Flint River Water   0 The magnitude of the elevated rate remained roughly the same during the  period after the water source switch   Lead abatement through MDHHS was federally funded up until FY14 when Michigan  began providing additional funds to abate homes   In FY14   1 25M General Fund was added  In FY15  General Fund was bumped up to   1 75M and FV16    Genera  Fund remains at  1 75M     Reducing and Removing Lead Exposure  Use only cold filtered water from the tap for drinking  cooking  and making baby  formula  Hot water is more likely to contain higher levels oflead  The lead in household  water usually comes from the service line that connects your house to the water main  or the plumbing in your house  not from the local water supply     in housing built before 1978  it can be assumed that the paint has lead unless tests show    otherwise     Make sure your child does not have access to peeling paint or chewable surfaces  painted with lead   based paint     Children and pregnant women should not be present in housing built before 1978 that is  undergoing renovation  They should not participate in activities that disturb old paint or  in cleaning up paint debris after work is completed     Create barriers between living play areas and lead sources  Until environmental clean     up is completed  you should clean and isolate all sources of lead                         0 Close and lock doors to keep children awayfrom chipping or peeling paint on  walls  You can also apply temporary barriers such as contact paper or duct tape   to cover holes in walls or to block children   s access to other sources of lead     Regularly wash children   s hands and toys  Hands and toys can become contaminated  from household dust or exterior soil  Both can be lead sources     Regularly wet   mop floors and wet wipe window components  Because household dust  is a major source of lead  you should wet   mop floors and wet wipe horizontal surfaces  every 2   3 weeks     0 WlndOWSlllS and wells can contain high levels of leaded dust  They should be  kept clean  if feasible  windows should be kept shut to prevent abrasion of  painted surfaces or opened from the top sash     Take off shoes when enteringthe house to prevent bringing lead  contaminated soil in  from outside     Prevent children from playing in bare soil  if possible  provide them with sandboxes   Plant grass on areas of bare soil or cover the soil with grass seed  mulch  or wood chips     if possible     0 Until the bare soil is covered  move play areas away from bare soiland away  from the sides ofthe house  if you have a sandbox  cover the box when not in  use to prevent cats from using it as a litter box  That will help protect children    from exposure to animal waste     Avoid using makeup  containers  cookware  or tableware to store or cook foods or  liquids that are not shown to be lead free     Remove recalled toys and toy jewelry immediately from children     Shower and change clothes afterfinishing a task that involves working with lead   based  products such as stained glass  making bullets  or using a firing range     if possible  shower and change before returning home if yourjob requires you to work with or  around lead  These jobs can include painting  plumbing  and some factory work     WIC Children    There are 855 infants

michigan gov    Dias          Privileged Attorney Client Communication November 16  2015    City of Flint Drinking Water  Outline prepared by the  Michigan Department of Environmental Quality for the  Flint Water Task Force    INTRODUCTION    This document is intended to provide an overview of Michigan   s implementation of  the Safe Drinking Water Act  1976 PA 399  as amended  Act 399   with respect to  events in the city of Flint  City   Michigan     BACKGROUND      How has Flint historically obtained its drinking water     The water system in the City was organized and built under private ownership in  1883 as the Flint Water Works Company to pump raw water from the Flint River to  their consumers  In 1903  the system was converted to a municipalIy owned  corporation which supplied drinking water to the City  In 1967  the City became a  customer of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department  DWSD  system     Afterthe switch to DWSD  the City operated its water treatment plant as a standby  plant for purposes of reliability in the event of an emergency  such as an interruption  in service of the single pipeline from DWSD  In the last ten years  the water  treatment plant was used as an emergency backup during two weeks in 2009     June 18 through June 20 and September 10 through September 13     As a backup emergency water treatment plant  the City was required to operate the  water treatment plant quarterly to demonstrate the capability to produce drinking  water in accordance with Act 399 and to keep mechanical equipment  such as  valves  rubber seals  etc   in good working order  Each quarter  the water treatment  plant was test run and samples were taken of both raw water and finished water   post   filters   Since the water treatment plant was upgraded in the early 20003   monitoring showed that the water treatment plant was performing as designed     Contractual obligations with DWSD did not allow treated water to be put into the  City   s distribution system during these test runs  Treated water was discharged to  the Flint River in accordance with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System   NPDES  Permit  The test runs were for demonstration purposes  to keep the water  treatment plant operational  and staff familiar with operation in the event it was  needed in an emergency       What State and Federal laws or rules exist to ensure safe drinking water is    provided to City residents     The federal Safe Drinking Water Act  federal SDWA  is the primary law that ensures  the quality of Americans  drinking water  Under the federal SDWA  the United States  Environmental Protection Agency  USEPA  sets standards for drinking water quality  and oversees the states  localities  and water suppliers who implement those  standards          Privileged Attorney Client Communication November 16  2015    The federal SDWA was originally passed by Congress in 1974 to protect public  health by regulating the nation s public drinking water supply  The law was amended  in 1986 and 1996 and requires many actions to protect drinking water and its  sources  rivers  lakes  reservoirs  springs  and ground water wells   The federal  SDWA does not regulate private wells which serve fewer than 25 individuals      Originally  the federal SDWA focused primarily on treatment as the means of  providing safe drinking water at the tap  The 1996 amendments greatly enhanced  the existing law by recognizing source water protection  operator training  funding for  water system improvements  and public information as important components of safe  drinking water  This approach ensures the quality of drinking water by protecting it  from source to tap     The most direct oversight of water systems is conducted by state drinking water  programs  States can apply to the USEPA for    primacy     the authority to implement  the federal SDWA within theirjurisdictions     if they will adopt standards at least as  stringent as the USEPA   s and enforce those standards  Michigan adopted the Safe  Drinking Water Act in 1976 through Act 399 and has maintained primacy for the  program since that time     3  What is the USEPA   s role as a regulatory agency in implementing the SDWA     Federal and state governments share responsibility for administering drinking water  programs  Under the federal SDWA  the USEPA is given the responsibility for  developing national standards and regulations that apply to the nation   s public  drinking water systems and enforcing those standards  by working with states     Michigan   s drinking water program is evaluated annually by the USEPA for  compliance with the federal SDWA  Based upon these evaluations  the USEPA  continues to find Michigan   s drinking water program to be compliant with the federal  SDWA     4  What is the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality   s  DEQ  role as a  regulatory agency in implementing the SDWA     The federal SDWA permits states to accept oversight of the drinking water program  under an agreement with the USEPA giving states primary enforcement  responsibilities  or primacy   In addition to this delegation of federal authority to the  states  states also have the power to create additional regulations and programs  governing drinking water suppliers through their own legislative and regulatory  processes  Michigan has had regulatory authority of public water supplies since  1913  Waterworks and Sewerage Systems  1913 PA 98      The DEQ has been granted primary enforcement authority in Michigan for the federal  SDWA under the authority of Act 399  As such  the DEQ  Office of Drinking Water  and Municipal Assistance  has regulatory oversight for all public water supplies   including approximately 1 400 community water supplies and 10 000 noncommunity  water supplies  A community water supply provides year   round service to 15 or  more living units  homes  apartments  dorm rooms  etc   or 25 or more residents  A  noncommunity water supply has 15 or more service connections or serves 25 or  more individuals on an average daily basis for not less than 60 days per year          Privileged Attorney Client Communication November 16  2015    The DEQ engages in a variety of activities to help water systems remain in  or return  to  compliance  These activities include  conducting surveillance visits  inspections   at water systems and reviewing facilities  equipment  and operations  requiring the  submission of plans and specifications for waterworks system improvements and  issuing construction permits  providing for the training  examination  certification and  regulation of persons operating water supplies  helping systems incorporate  preventive measures  and since 1996  providing financial assistance for system  improvements     5  What is the City   s role in implementing the federal SDWA and Act 399     State and federal programs develop regulations and perform oversight and  compliance activities  but do not treat or deliver water to customers  At the local  level  public and private water utilities collect  treat  and deliver drinking water to  consumers in compliance with state and federal regulations     The federal SDWA and Act 399 set up multiple barriers against contamination   These barriers include  source water protection  multiple treatment components   distribution system integrity  proper operations oversight  and public information  As  the owner of a public water system  the City is responsible for knowing and following  all requirements under Act 399  such as ensuring proper design  construction   operations and maintenance  so that contaminants in tap water do not exceed the  standards established by law  The City treats the water  and must test its water  routinely for specified contaminants and report the results to the DEQ  If a water  system is not meeting these standards  it is the water supplier   s responsibility to  notify its customers     The federal SDWA and Act 399 recognize that customers have the right to know  what is in their drinking water and where it comes from  The City  like all water  suppliers  must notify consumers when there is a problem with water quality     The City submits samples of its water for laboratory testing  monitoring  to verify the  water it provides to residents meets all federal and state standards  How often and  where samples are taken varies from system to system and from contaminant to  contaminant  The DEQ provides an annual monitoring schedule to the City setting  forth these requirements     In addition  the City is required to employ properly certified water operators that are  trained and experienced to operate the treatment and distribution systems  associated with the City   s water system     6  What approvals were needed from the DEQ in order for the City to begin using  its water treatment plant full time     The City had long ago been issued construction permits for raw water pumps to  withdraw water from the Flint River and the City was grandfathered under the water  withdrawal program  Part 327  Great Lakes Preservation  of the Natural Resources  and Environmental Protection Act  1994 PA 451  as amended   as were all existing  community public water systems at that time  There were no additional DEQ         Privileged Attorney Client Communication November 16  2015    permissions or authorizations required under Act 399 because the City already had  approval to use the water treatment plant     Under Act 399  there are no licenses or permits required to operate public water  systems  The City did apply for and obtained two construction permits prior to the  water treatment plant changing from an emergency backup plant to full   time  operation  These permits were for new chemical feed equipment  changes to the  electrical service  etc     THE FLINT RIVER     IS IT A SAFE SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER     Seventy   five percent of Michigan   s population served by a public water supply  receive their drinking water from surface water sources  the majority of which is  withdrawn from the Great Lakes  However  several public water supplies in Michigan  utilize water from inland rivers  All surface water sources require significant  treatment in order to be safe for consumption     While all surface water sources must receive a high level of treatment  inland river  sources present a greater challenge than water withdrawn from one of the Great  Lakes because of rapidly changing water quality conditions  Under most  circumstances  rivers are prone to greater fluctuations in temperature  have higher  amounts of organic material  greater turbidity  suspended solids   and are more  vulnerable to microbiological and viral contamination than Lakes Huron  Erie   Michigan or Superior  While the water chemistry in the Flint River differs from that in  Lake Huron  it can still be treated in accordance with the federal SDWA and Act 399   The waterworks industry has the technology to treat wide ranging source waters to  provide potable and palatable drinking water  including direct reuse of treated  wastewater  Regardless of source water quality  all public water systems must  comply with the same drinking water standards in the finished water     It is not the source water that reacts with the homeowners plumbing in the  distribution system  but rather the finished water quality that is important  Treated  water leaving the City   s water treatment plant does not contain lead  In addition  the  treatment process employed by the City includes lime softening to reduce the  hardness in the river water  The City includes lime softening and pH adjustment  primarily to improve aesthetic water quality associated with hardness  Lime  softening is not a process that water supply professionals would expect to increase  corrosivity of water  The City  however  does practice recarbonation to readjust pH  at the end of the softening process     pH levels of finished water leaving the City   s water treatment plant averaged 7 7   Expanded water monitoring conducted quarterly at 25 sample sites located  throughout the distribution system showed the following     July     September 2014 average pH   7 71 range  7 56     7 86  October     December 2014 average pH   7 88 range  7 62     8 10  January      March 2015 average pH   7 81 range  7 60     7 99  April     June 2015 average pH   7 63 range  7 48     7 80         Privileged Attorney   Client Communication November 16  2015    The data below was obtained at ten of the sampling locations throughout the City   s  distribution system  while they were still purchasing water from DWSD before the  City switched to the Flint River as a source     January     March 2014  DWSD  average pH   7 47 range  7 40     7 54  April 2014  DWSD  average pH   7 49 range  7 42     7 59    Note that the pH of the treated water produced while the City was using the Flint  River did not differ significantly from pH values seen in the distribution system during  the time the City purchased water from DWSD  Thus  pH monitoring provided no  indication of a change in water corrosivity     E  COLI AND TOTAL COLIFORM BACTERIA VIOLATIONS      What caused the E  coli and total coliform bacteria violations experienced by    the City in August and September 2014     A number of factors  primarily related to distribution system operation and  maintenance  likely contributed to the Boil Water Advisories in the City during August  and September 2014 triggered by exceedances of bacteria standards in limited  areas of the distribution system  In addition  the coliform detections were confined to  less than 20 percent of the water system  Had the detections been the result of a  failure in treatment  detections would have been expected throughout the City rather  than in such a limited geographic area     Instead  the violations seem to have been caused by other factors such as aging  infrastructure  The City   s water distribution system has suffered from a lack of  infrastructure investment and asset management  Most of the City   s over 550 miles  of water mains are now over 75 years old  and constructed of unlined cast iron  piping  This cast iron pipe is subject to tuberculation  which thins and weakens the  pipe walls in some areas and causes a buildup of sediment and debris on the pipe  walls in other areas  Tuberculation can lead to water quality issues as well as  reduced flows and pressures  Tuberculation also encourages the development of  biofilms  Biofilm growth may occur more frequently in areas where little or no  disinfectant is maintained     The City has also experienced decades of a declining customer base and water use   with vacant homes  commercial businesses  and industrial property  Declining water  use leads to excess residence time  water age  within the City   s distribution pipes  and water storage facilities  accelerating tuberculation  biofilm growth  and reductions  of disinfectant concentration in the distribution system  While the City has recently  seen an infusion of funding for blight removal  contractors using fire hydrants to  complete this work have been known to cause hydraulic disturbances that dislodge  and suspend settled debris  which may contribute to the bacterial contamination   These hydraulic disturbances were also believed to be a source of the aesthetic  water quality complaints both the City and the DEQ were receiving     The winter of 2013   2014 was also one of the coldest experienced by the water  system  The City  which historically has unaccounted water losses of over    30 percent  saw even greater losses since February 2014 due to an increase in cold  weather related water main breaks and leaks  City personnel reported 400 water         Privileged Attorney Client Communication November 16  2015    main breaks in calendar year 2014  with greater than 50 percent in the winter  quarter   The City has also been lacking a formal maintenance program for its more  than 7 250 valves  which are critical in limiting the areas impacted during water main  repairs  As an example  two valves on the transmission line used to supply the area  of the 2014 Boil Water Advisories were found to be closed during the City   s  investigation of possible sources  causing much longer residence times  reduced  disinfectant concentrations  and reduced pressures     all potential avenues for  contamination to enter a distribution system     The Boil Water Advisories also occurred during the warmest and relatively wet  periods of August and September 2014  Warm weather conditions are not only more  conducive to bacterial growth but also degrade disinfectant concentrations more  quickly  As already explained  longer residence times  biofilms  and tuberculation  contribute to lowered disinfectant concentrations  Warm  wet weather conditions  also allow water contaminated with bacteria to accumulate or pond around piping  that leaks and breaks     During the summer of 2014  the City was actively repairing the distribution system   City personnel reported 29 water main breaks in June through August 2014   After  the switch to the Flint River  it was discovered that there were many broken or closed  valves in the distribution system  City personnel reported 120 broken valves and    239 valves in an improper position   As the City began correcting these problems   they did detect the presence of coliform organisms in the distribution system in  testing conducted as a result of the repairs  This sporadic detection is not an  unusual occurrence  Many communities have experienced similar issues when  significant repairs are made in the system and or they suffer water main breaks and  localized pressure losses     2  How were the violations detected  What was the DEQ   s response     Federal SDWA regulations regarding monitoring and standards for bacteria in water  distribution systems are incorporated into Act 399  There are a variety of bacteria   parasites  and viruses which can potentially cause health problems if humans ingest  them in drinking water  Testing water for each of these potential pathogens would be  difficult and expensive  Instead  community water systems are required to test  monthly for total coliform and E  coli  Total coliform bacteria  while not pathogenic   often originate from the same sources as many pathogens  Therefore  the presence  of total coliform in drinking water indicates there may be a pathway for pathogens or  other contaminants to enter the system  The absence of total coliforms in the  distribution system indicates a minimal likelihood that pathogens are present  E  coli  is itself a pathogen and its detection is considered direct evidence of a health risk     The Boil Water Advisories which occurred in the City were associated with bacteria  monitoring detections and violations of bacteria standards  These advisories were  issued by the City after consultation with the DEQ     Upon receiving information indicating total coliform and E  coli bacteria had been    detected  the DEQ advised the City to issue a Boil Water Advisory from August 15  through 20  2014  for the affected portion of the City  Another Boil Water Advisory  was issued from September 5 through 9  2014  due to localized detections of total         Privileged Attorney   Client Communication November 16  2015    coliform bacteria in the same and adjacent portions of the City  The advisories  covered an area of less than 20 percent of the water department   s service area     Once a Boil Water Advisory has been issued  time is needed to investigate potential  causes and implement corrective measures  The larger the water system  the more  time this may take  Once corrective measures have been taken  samples must be  collected and analyzed to confirm that bacteria are no longer present  Under  approved analytical methods used by the City  samples must be incubated for 24  hours before results can be obtained  In situations where the bacterial contamination  has been confirmed  two consecutive rounds of safe samples collected at least 24  hours apart are normally obtained before canceling a Boil WaterAdvisory  Adding  each of these steps together  a normal response period to rescind a Boil Water  Advisory under these circumstances would be expected to take 3 to 4 days     V  TOTAL TRIHALOMETHANES  TTHM  VIOLATIONS    1  What caused the TTHM violations experienced by the City beginning in late  summer 2014     Disinfectants are an essential element of drinking water treatment because of the  barrier they provide against waterborne disease   causing microorganisms  However   disinfection byproducts form when disinfectants used to treat drinking water react  with naturally occurring organic materials in the water  e g   decomposing plant  material   The formation of disinfection byproducts continues to occur as water  travels throughout water distribution systems     A major challenge for water suppliers is how to provide protection from pathogens  while simultaneously minimizing health risks to the population from disinfection  byproducts  Total Trihalomethanes  TTHM     chloroform  bromoform   bromodichloromethane  and dibromochloromethane  and halogenated acetic acids   HAA5   monochloro     dichloro   trichloro   monobromo     dibromo     are widely  occurring classes of disinfection byproducts  The amount of TTHM and HAA5 in  drinking water can change depending on the season  water temperature  amount of  chlorine added  the amount of plant material in the water  and a variety of other  factors  All community water systems that chemically disinfect or purchase water  that has been chemically disinfected are required to monitor for disinfection  byproducts     The Flint River has higher levels of organic material than water in the Great Lakes  and as a result  the water produced by the City developed higher disinfection  byproducts than the water purchased from DWSD  Because the water treatment  plant was previously operating intermittently  it was not possible to predict  disinfection byproduct levels at distribution system compliance points until the City  began relying on its water treatment plant continuously     As mentioned previously  the City became aware that there were numerous broken  valves and closed valves that should have been open in the distribution system  At  that time  the City also began a mapping effort to identify    water age    in the  distribution system  The longer the residence time or    water age    the greater the  opportunity for the formation of disinfection byproducts          Privileged Attorney Client Communication November 16  2015    VI     2  How were the violations detected  What was the DEQ   s response     Disinfection byproducts are monitored at eight sites throughout the distribution  system  A locational running annual average is calculated for each individual site   Because TTHM and HAA5 maximum contaminant levels are calculated based on a  running annual average at specific distribution system locations  the actual violation  of the standard did not occur until the fall of 2014  However  because it was  apparent in the summer of 2014 that the standard would eventually be exceeded  the  DEQ asked the City to proactively implement measures to address the problem  before the violation required them to do so     As a result of maintenance efforts undertaken by the City to repair valves and correct  improperly closed valves  the City was able to improve water flow in the distribution  system and thereby reduce residence time or    water age    in the system  Operational  changes made to reduce the amount of storage in the system also helped reduce  residence time which contributed to a reduction in disinfection byproduct formation     In addition to operational changes to minimize residence time in the distribution  system  the City added granular activated carbon to its filters in July 2015  Levels of  TTHMs and HAA5s were reduced and the City returned to compliance on  September 1  2015     THE TASTE  ODOR  AND COLOR COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY FLINT      What caused the taste  odor  and color complaints received by the City from    residents     Taste  odor  and color issues are very personalized  While water leaving the water  treatment plant did not have any unusual taste  odor or color  during the summer  after the switch to the Flint River  customer complaints increased  Construction in  the distribution system  hydrant flushing  and changes in flow characteristics are all  known causes of disturbances within the distribution system that can cause an  increase in taste  odor  and color complaints  Aesthetics  such as taste  odor  and  color  while a concern  by themselves are not a threat to public health       What was the DEQ   s response     The DEQ consulted with the City regarding these complaints  The City indicated that  they were offering to investigate such complaints for anyone that had issues  but City  personnel informed the DEQ that they were not able to recreate these situations in  the field  In addition  as a result of the repair work that was underway and the  increased flushing to reduce water age in the system to help control TTHMs  it was  anticipated that there would be short   term disturbances in the system that would  cause color and odor complaints  All water supplies are advised to provide notice to  residents prior to undertaking a flushing program because flushing  even routine  flushing  often causes temporary problems as described  Based on information from  City personnel  it appeared that the complaints were related to such operational  activities occurring in the distribution system          Privileged Attorney   Client Communication November 16  2015    VII     LEAD ISSUES IN THE FLINT DRINKING WATER      What causes lead in drinking water     Lead is rarely found in source water  Lead enters tap water through corrosion of  plumbing materials  Homes built before 1986 are more likely to have lead fixtures  and solder  Older homes built prior to World War II are more likely to contain lead  pipes  The most common problem with newer construction is with brass or chrome     plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach significant amounts of lead into the  water  especially hot water  The amount of lead in tap water also depends on the  types and amounts of minerals in the water  how long the water stays in the pipes   the amount of wear in the pipes  the pH of the water  and its temperature       What is the Lead and Copper Rule     On June 7  1991  the USEPA published a regulation to control lead and copper in  drinking water  This regulation is known as the Lead and Copper Rule  also referred  to as the LCR   The treatment technique for the rule requires systems to monitor  drinking water at customer taps  If the 90th percentile for lead exceeds an action  level of 15 parts per billion  ppb  or the 90th percentile for copper exceeds an action  level of 1 3 parts per million  ppm   the system must undertake a number of  additional actions to control corrosion  If the action level for lead is exceeded  the  water supply must also inform the public about steps they should take to protect their  health and the water supply may have to replace lead service lines under their  control       What is the lead action level     For most contaminants  the USEPA sets an enforceable regulation called a  maximum contaminant level based on the maximum contaminant level goal   Maximum contaminant levels are set as close to the maximum contaminant level  goals as possible  considering cost  benefits  and the ability of public water systems  to detect and remove contaminants at the water treatment plant using suitable  treatment technologies  Because lead contamination of drinking water often results  from corrosion of the plumbing materials belonging to water system customers  the  USEPA established a treatment technique rather than a maximum contaminant level  for lead  A treatment technique is an enforceable procedure or level of technological  performance which water systems must follow to control a contaminant  Although  the maximum contaminant level goal for lead is zero  based upon the above factors   the USEPA has established the action level for lead at 15 ppb     The treatment technique regulation for lead requires water systems that produce  drinking water to control the corrosivity of the water  The regulation also requires  systems to collect customer tap samples from sites served by the system that are  more likely to have plumbing materials containing lead  Ifthe 90th percentile action  level for lead is exceeded  then water systems are required to take additional actions  including     0 Optimizing corrosion control treatment  for water systems serving greater than  50 000 people that have not fully optimized corrosion control           Privileged Attorney Client Communication November 16  2015      Educating the public about lead in drinking water and actions consumers can  take to reduce their exposure to lead       Replacing the portions of lead service lines  lines that connect distribution  mains to customers  under the water system   s control     4  Did DWSD have optimized corrosion control treatment     After the LCR passed in 1991  DWSD and all of its consecutive customer systems  conducted two rounds of monitoring for lead and copper  Copper levels were well  below action level limits  but lead levels exceeded the action level of 15 ppb for  DWSD and many of its customer communities  As a result  DWSD installed  corrosion control treatment  DWSD performed a corrosion control study and  concluded that they could reduce the corrosivity of the water by the addition of an  orthophosphate  a corrosion inhibitor     5  Did the DEQ require the City to have corrosion control in place when it  switched to the Flint River as its source of drinking water     No  There are two ways under the LCR to deem a water supply as providing     optimal corrosion control        either by sampling and determining through a  calculation that the supply is    optimal    or by installing treatment if it is needed  The  DEQ requested that the City perform two 6   month rounds of monitoring to  demonstrate if the City was practicing optimal corrosion control treatment  According  to state regulations  R32510604f 2  b  iii    a system can demonstrate optimized  corrosion controls by sampling in two  consecutive 6 month monitoring periods and  comparing the results of this monitoring to the lead level in the source  Optimal  corrosion control under this scenario would be defined as having the 90th percentile  in each of these monitoring periods lower than the sum of the lead in the source and  the practical quantification limit for lead of 5 ppb  Since the source water has 0 ppb  lead  the City would have been deemed optimal if its 90th percentile of lead was    5 ppb or less in these two consecutive periods  However  once a system has  installed treatment  it would also be considered optimized regardless of the 90th  percentile level achieved  as long as it does not exceed the action level of 15 ppb     In this case  the City had been purchasing water from DWSD that was treated for  corrosion control  it was the DWSD water system that was considered as having  optimized corrosion control at that point  Since the City water system had not been  the supplier of water before  the DEQ did not require the City to maintain corrosion  control for which it was not responsible  R325 10604f 2  b 1  It could not  maintain     operations undertaken elsewhere by a different entity for a different source of water   The DEQ   s instructions to the City were consistent with past practices afforded to all  other large water systems  At the beginning of the LCR  all large systems were  initially granted the option to demonstrate optimal corrosion control treatment through  full scale monitoring under the applicable rules  For these reasons  two 6   month  rounds of monitoring  as required by the LCR  were the required means to determine  whether or not optimal corrosion control was being achieved     6  How does the DEQ calculate the 90th percentile     To determine the 90th percentile of a list of lead or copper results  the procedure  below is followed     10         Privileged Attorney Client Communication November 16  2015    Step 1  Place lead or copper results in ascending order    Step 2  Assign each sample a number  1 for lowest value    Step 3  Multiply the total number of samples by 0 9     this yields the 90th percentile  sample  For example  20 samples x 0 9   18th sample  This is the 90th  percentile level     Calculating the 90th percentile is easiest when a supply collects 10 samples  or a  multiple of 10   Note that the 90th percentile must be interpolated if the number of  samples is not a multiple of 10     7  What was the result of the first round of monitoring conducted by the City     The first 65 month round of lead and copper monitoring conducted by the City ended  on December 31  2014  One hundred samples were submitted and the 90th  percentile lead level was calculated to be 6 ppb  The next step required by the DEQ  was for the City to collect a second round of monitoring     8  What was the result of the second round of monitoring conducted by the City     The second 6   month round of lead and copper monitoring conducted by the City  ended on June 30  2015  Sixty nine samples that complied with the site selection  criteria were submitted and the 90th percentile lead level was calculated to be    11 ppb  The conclusion from these results was that the City  while in compliance  with the action level  exceeded the level required to be deemed as having optimized  corrosion control     9  Why was the City required to collect 100 compliance samples for lead and  copper in the first 6 month monitoring period of July through December of  2014 and then only 60 compliance samples in the second 6 month period of  January through June of 2015     The number of compliance samples required for lead and copper is based upon the  population served by the water system as identified in the table below  taken from  Rule 325 10710a of Act 399                                                       Supply Size Number

101 to 500 10 5    Fewer than 101 5 5         The number of samples the City was required to collect in the first round of  monitoring after they began relying on the Flint River was based on the 2010 census   which listed the City   s population as more than 100 000 residents  In March of 2015   the City provided updated information that indicated the City   s population had  decreased to less than 100 000  Therefore  they were only required to collect 60  samples  There is no rule prohibiting the collection of additional compliance samples      only establishing a minimum number necessary     11              Privileged Attorney   Client Communication November 16  2015    10  What actions did the DEQ order the City to undertake after the second round of  monitoring     While the City   s LCR compliance monitoring continued to meet action level  requirements  the City exceeded the level required to be deemed as having  optimized corrosion control  Following receipt of the City   s compliance monitoring  results  the DEQ sent a letter on August 17  2015  requiring the City to install  corrosion control treatment     Under the LCR  the City has 6 months to let the DEQ know whether it intends to  conduct a study  then 18 months to perform the study and make its recommendation   and 24 months to complete installation of the selected corrosion control  The DEQ  requested the City accelerate this schedule  The City submitted plans and  specifications to install corrosion control treatment and a construction permit was  issued by the DEQ on October 28  2015  The City is in the process of installing the  necessary equipment and procuring the appropriate chemicals  Treatment is  expected to be on   line by the end of November 2015  As of October 16  2015  the  City resumed purchasing water from DWSD that is already optimized and provides a  corrosion inhibitor  The additional treatment by the City will further enhance the  amount of inhibitor in the system     11  What had Michigan Department of Health and Human Services  DHHS  advised  the DEQ regarding blood lead levels prior to the DEQ ordering the City to  implement optimized corrosion control     In an e   mail dated July 28  2015  regarding blood lead testing  the  Michigan DHHS indicated that they           compared lead testing rates and lead testing results to the  same time frame for the previous 3 years  to see if there were  any patterns that suggested that there were increased rates of  lead poisoning after the water supply was switched  Per the  attached charts          Lead testing rates remained about the same from  year   to   year        City of Flint  Children less than 16 years of age  with First Time Elevated Blood Lead Levels    30    20    10         May June

the previous three years  especially in 2011   2012  we are  working with our Epidemiologist to statistically verify any  significant differences        We commonly see a    seasonal effect    with lead  related to  people opening and closing windows more often in the summer   which disturbs old deteriorating paint on the windows  sills and  sashes  Window fans frequently blow and spread the lead dust  from the deteriorating paint to other parts of the room house  We  suspected that the summer data spike may be related to this  effect       If the home water supply lines and or river water were  contributing to elevated blood lead tests  we expected that the  increased rates would extend beyond the summer  but they drop  quite a bit from September to October  stayed low over the  winter  and arejust starting to tail up again in the spring of 2015        This e   mail from DHHS in concert with the completion of two 6   month rounds of lead  compliance sampling data indicating that the City had not exceeded an action level  for lead provided the basis for the DEQ to maintain that the water in the City  continued to be in compliance with the federal SDWA and Act 399     12  When did the DEQ first become aware of allegations of elevated blood levels  being detected in certain children     The DEQ was notified on August 23  2015  by a professor from Virginia Tech that     over the next few months we will be studying Flint water quality issues     Results  indicating elevated lead levels in homes were reported as part of this study in late  August  In September 2015  information was reported in news articles that    13         Privileged Attorney   Client Communication November 16  2015    VIII     pediatricians in the City had data suggesting an increase in children   s blood lead  levels in two zip codes in the Flint area     Prior to these dates  the City had already completed the required two 6   month  rounds of monitoring and the DEQ had made a determination that the City must  install corrosion control treatment as documented in correspondence dated  August 17  2015     QUESTIONS RAISED REGARDING THE DEQ   S ACTIONS      What was the DEQ   s response to the USEPA   s inquiry in February 2015    regarding the optimized corrosion control treatment being implemented by the  City under the LCR     The DEQ indicated that the City was complying with the LCR  the lead 90th  percentile level was below the action level of 15 ppb  and the City was already  conducting the second round of monitoring which would provide for a determination  of whether additional treatment needed to be installed  It should be noted that once  treatment is designated as optimal  there is no requirement in the LCR that lead  results be lower than they were before treatment was installed  The 90th percentile  only needs to be lower than the action level in the LCR     Did the DEQ attempt to mislead the USEPA in a February 27  2015  e mail  responding to the USEPA   s inquiry regarding Optimal Corrosion Control  Treatment     No  There was no attempt by the DEQ to mislead the USEPA  There is an e   mail  from Steve Busch  Jackson and Lansing District Supervisor  Office of Drinking  Water and Municipal Assistance  indicating that the City was practicing a corrosion  control program  What was meant was that the City was performing the required  monitoring to determine whether or not they were practicing optimized corrosion  control  The DEQ subsequently clarified its position in follow   up e   mails and  telephone conversations with the USEPA     When General Motors announced its intent to terminate water service from the  City and purchase water from Genesee County  should this have been a sign  that there were concerns with the quality of the water after the switch to the  Flint River     No  General Motors made a decision regarding the quality of water for its  manufacturing processes  At the time  the company indicated that the chloride levels  were above limits acceptable as part of the manufacturing facility   s limit for  production purposes  The level of chlorides in the water treated by the City was not  a human health or aesthetic concern     Chloride does have a secondary maximum contaminant level established by the  USEPA  not for health   related concerns but rather for taste and aesthetic concerns   Concentrations greater than the secondary maximum contaminant level of    250 milligrams per liter  mg I  become objectionable due to taste  According to the  City   s records  the chloride concentration in the Flint River water is generally about  45 mg l and the treated water chloride concentration leaving the water treatment    14         Privileged Attorney   Client Communication November 16  2015    plant ranges between 55 and 65 mg l  It should be noted that the City uses ferric  chloride as its primary coagulant  although this does not add a significant amount of  chloride to the finished water     4  Has the USEPA subsequently admitted that the LCR is subject to differing  interpretations such as that presented by the DEQ     Yes  On November 3  2015  the USEPA issued a memorandum regarding the    Lead  and Copper Rule Requirements for Optimal Corrosion Control Treatment for Large  Drinking Water Systems   This memorandum addresses concerns raised about the  application of the LCR  specifically the requirements pertaining to maintenance of  optimal corrosion control treatment  in situations in which a large water system  ceases to purchase treated water and switches to a new drinking water source  The  USEPA states that this type of situation rarely arises  that the language of the LCR  does not specifically discuss such circumstances  and that there are differing  possible interpretations of the LCR with respect to how the rule   s optimal corrosion  control treatment procedures apply to this situation  The memorandum is intended to  clarify  on a prospective basis  steps agencies should take or apply in the future   USEPA   s new guidance provides acknowledgement that the LCR is subject to  differing interpretations  The DEQ   s interpretation and application of the LCR in this  situation was in compliance with the federal SDWA and Act 399     5  Did the DEQ reject any of the samples submitted by the City     Yes  samples at two locations were excluded from the compliance calculation in  conformance with rules issued by the USEPA     According to the LCR  compliance samples must be a first draw  1 liter sample  collected from a cold water  kitchen or bathroom tap after the tap has stood unused  for not less than 6 hours  Federal and state rules require community public water  systems to identify a pool of targeted high   risk sampling sites  called Tier 1 sampling  sites  For a municipality such as the City  the Tier 1 sampling pool must consist of  single family structures that are       served by a lead service line       contain lead pipes  or      contain copper pipes soldered with lead installed after 1982 but before Michigan  enacted the ban on solder containing high concentrations of lead  June  1988      As long as a community has Tier 1 sites that contain lead service lines  they are  required to collect at least 50 percent of their compliance samples from these lead  service line sites  Finally  federal and state rules specify that  Sampling sites may  not include faucets that have point of use or point of entry treatment devices  designed to remove inorganic contaminants     Such treatment devices include home  softeners  iron filters  etc  Samples collected from multiple family residences   commercial buildings  institutional facilities  or single family structures with  point   of use or point of   entry treatment can only be used ifthe community has  insufficient Tier 1 sites available     15         Privileged Attorney Client Communication November 16  2015    One of the samples submitted by the City was excluded from the 90th percentile  compliance calculation in the latest monitoring period because it was taken from a  tap at a non residential site  non Tier 1   The other sample result that was excluded  was collected from a single family home that has a whole house treatment system   Both of these sites are  therefore  excluded from the compliance consideration based  upon federal and state rules     6  Did the DEQ review the information submitted by the City to ensure all  samples were from Tier 1 sites     Yes  The DEQ examined the information submitted and certified by the City that its  LCR compliance monitoring sites consisted entirely of Tier 1 criteria sites  which met  the requirements of this rule to maximize sampling of high   risk targeted sites     During the initial implementation of the LCR approximately 25 years ago  water  supplies were required to complete a materials evaluation of their distribution system  to identify a pool of targeted  high   risk sampling sites  These sites were to be  categorized into one of three Tiers  1  2  or 3  based on risk  The DEQ created an  LCR reporting template for water systems to identify each compliance sampling site  by Tier  service line material  and building plumbing material     If a water system has sufficient Tier 1 sites  they are required to sample them before  using any lower Tier sites  Furthermore  if they have sufficient sampling sites with  lead service lines  they are required to use them to make up at least 50 percent of  their sampling pool each monitoring period  Water supplies are also required to use  the same sampling siteseach time or explain on their LCR reporting form why they  were unable to do so  Finally  the water system is required to certify all of the  information they provide on the LCR reporting form is factual     The DEQ must rely upon the public water system to identify appropriate sampling  sites for LCR monitoring  The DEQ public water supply program has no control or  authority over service lines or domestic plumbing  As a result  we have no records  on construction standards or materials used by customers for these components  If  these records exist  they are kept by plumbing code enforcement officials     In 2015  City employees again certified that the information submitted on their LCR  monitoring reports for the two 63 month rounds of monitoring conducted after they  began treating the Flint River were accurate  and DEQ staff review of that  information indicated it was in compliance with the monitoring requirements  The  DEQ had no reason to question the validity of the City   s reports until the DEQ heard  City employees revealing to the media that the City did not know for certain if its  compliance monitoring was collected from homes with lead service lines  As a  result  the DEQ began to investigate the City   s monitoring sites  As the City began to  transfer its customer information to electronicrecords  the DEQ determined from the  information available that a significant number of these sites that had been listed as  having lead service lines either did not have them or the information was unavailable   On November 9  2015  the DEQ notified the City in writing that it would be necessary  to conduct a complete assessment of its sampling pool and report back its findings  by December 30  2015  The DEQ is now awaiting the City   s response     16         Privileged Attorney   Client Communication November 16  2015    7  Did the DEQ believe the levels of lead found at 212 Browning in April 2015  were indicative of a system wide problem     High levels of lead were collected in samples taken from this residence  It was  determined to be coming from an unusually long lead service line  For some reason   this home was not connected to the water main that ran in front of the house  but  rather to a main located on a street several houses away  The City replaced the lead  service line May 6  2015  Since the internal plumbing of the house is plastic  it was  believed that replacement of the lead service line would resolve the problem  and  subsequent sampling taken at this address showed that replacement of the service  line did mitigate the problem  There was  therefore  no reason to believe that this  was indicative of a system   wide problem     8  Do the DEQ   s sampling instructions comply with the LCR     The DEQ continues to seek official clarification from the USEPA regarding the  sampling protocols  The DEQ   s sampling recommendations were developed to  ensure compliance with the USEPA   s guidance provided in the preamble to their lead  and copper regulations that said that household use should be    typical    for a  residential customer on the day before sample collection for lead and copper  Early  in the implementation of the LCR  the DEQ had encountered too many situations  where compliance samples had been collected from kitchen and bathroom taps that  had not been used in days and in some cases  even weeks  resulting in excessively  stagnated water and correspondingly high lead levels that did not represent typical  exposure expected after overnight stagnation  To incorporate these results into  further regulatory decision making could have led to actions that were not indicative  of a true public health threat  Further complicating this issue was the USEPA   s direct  implementation of the LCR in Washington  D C   where it was learned that some     valid    lead results were not always being included in compliance calculations   Subsequently  the USEPA made invalidation of samples for any reason much more  difficult  In order to ensure samples were taken at customer taps representative of  typical use  the DEQ devised the current recommendations for ensuring appropriate  but not excessive stagnation for LCR monitoring     The DEQ continues to believe it is appropriate to ensure that taps being sampled are  representative of typical household use and are sampled during the recommended  stagnation period of 6 18 hours  The LCR does not say the result should represent  the    absolute worst case  condition     it talks about sampling the highest risk  locations  lead plumbing  lead service lines  high lead content solder piping  etc    after overnight stagnation and then collecting a first draw sample so as not to flush  elevated lead from that tap at that point in time  There are a number of other states  that share the DEQ   s interpretation of the rule and the DEQ encourages the USEPA  to provide official clarification directed at all states with primacy     17         Privileged Attorney   Client Communication November 16  2015    9  Does the DEQ require the use of small neck bottles to obtain samples     No  The DEQ does not mandate the use of small neck bottles  it is the sampling  method that is specified in both the federal SDWA and Act 399  Each certified  drinking water laboratory provides bottles to their customers upon request for any  particular analysis in accordance with the specifications in the SDWA  The bottles  provided by the DEQ Drinking Water Laboratory for a lead and copper corrosion  control sample meet these requirements     18         From  Snyder  Rick  GOV   Sent  Thursday  December 03 2015 12  52 PM    To

call between members of the Flint Water Advisory Task Force   F WATF   yourself  and members of your administration  Attached is a follow up letter to that conference call  outlining an initial set of recommendations that we believe should be implemented in the very near future to    focus the state s efforts to protect the public health in Flint     We both acknowledge and appreciate your personal interest in this issue and your commitment  not only to  assisting the Task Force in our review  hut  most importantly    to ensuring that the full measure of state  resources are brought forward to protect the public health in Flint and throughout the state     Respectfully     Ken Sikkema    Ken Sikkema    Senior Policy Fellow    Public Sector Consultants    PH  517484 4954    ksildcema pscinc com    December 7  2015        Dear Governor Snyder     On Wednesday  November 18  2015  the Flint Water Advisory Task Force met with representatives of  the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality  MDEQ  and the Michigan Department of Health  and Human SeNices  MDHHS  to discuss elements ofthe 10   point Action Plan designed to address  various issues related to the ongoing public health protection challenges precipitated by lead in the Flint  water supply  These discussions Were held at our request as part of ourtask to make recommendations  to prevent a similar occurrence in Flint or elsewhere  and also to monitor ongoing mitigation efforts     Subsequent to those meetings  on Tuesday  November 24  2015  members of the Task Force  participated in a conference call with yourself  members of the Administration  and representatives of  these agencies to discuss the progress to date on the 10 point Action Plan  as well as several other  related issues     We want to acknowledge the steps that have already been taken to implement the action plan   specifically in the areas of outreach efforts to facilitate blood lead testing for children  communication  with health care providers In the Flint community about the importance of testing children for lead  and  the training ofadditional public health nurses in the Genesee County Health Department  We do  believe  however  that additional steps need to be taken to reach additional children for blood lead  testing  assure proper follow   up with children found to have elevated blood lead levels  and to continue  water testing  We will continue to assess state and local efforts and make recommendations regarding    specific steps that we believe are warranted     One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to be taking place in the  absence of a larger project coordination framework that measures results and clearly delineates  responsibilities for continuing actions to protect public health  We believe the state is best positioned to    facilitate this largerframework  which should address the following     1  The need for MDHHS and MDEQ   and  possibly  other state agencies   to set goals for actions in  collaboration with local and federal agencies and organizations     2  The need for a set of corresponding timelines for the goals     3  The need to establish responsibilityfor meeting the goals in a timely fashion and for    contingency plans for the state if the goals are not being met     The need for clear  regular communication with the Flint community and stakeholder groups    regarding action steps and updates       We also believe it important that a single person or entity   potentially independent of any one  particular state agency and mutually agreeable to this Task Force and you  Governor   be established to  provide effective coordination of ongoing activities and reporting on the status of mitigation measures   For this  we also believe a readily understood    dashboard    should be developed that reports on the  goals  timelines and assignments  This will enable members ofthe Flint community  public health  providers  and state agencies to know about the status of the Flint water crisis mitigation program  as    well as promote coordination and accountability  The Task Force is prepared to assist in the  development ofthat dashboard     We believe it is vitally important that trusted members of the Flint community be engaged in  communication on this issue  as well as the distribution of information conveyed by our suggested    dashboard reporting  Accordingly  in advance ofourfinal report  we would like to ensure the  independent coordinator suggested above engage trusted community groups to begin rebuilding    community trust in state actions     We appreciate your personal interest in this issue  commitment to assisting the Task Force in our  review  and   most importantly   commitment to ensuring that the full measure of state resources are    brought forward to protect the public health in Flint and throughout the state     Respectfully yours     Flint Water Advisory Task Force

answers on Flint water situation    Colleagues     Here is a summary of answers from the Office of the Auditor General in response to questions mostly posed by Sen  Jim  Ananich s office  the auditor added a few questions in the 11 page report   The questions came as the OAG conducts an  audit of the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance   s handling of the Flint water crisis     Conclusions     While the City Council voted in March 2013 to move to the KWA pipeline  it didn   t designate the Flint River as an interim  water source  But the DEQ had approved the river as a backup source for emergency purposes in 2005  The treated  water met safety standards in quarterly tests by the Flint WTP  but Flint had never tested its effect on the distribution    system     In an email review of key DEQ managers to determine Ifthere was an effort to conCeal information  only one email  exchange raised red flags  The EPA had asked DEQ in February 2015 if Flint had a corrosion control program  the DEQ  responded the city had an optimized program in place  But in April the EPA asked again  and the DEQ said that the Flint  WaterTreatment Plant  WTP  was not doing corrosion control  DEQ later explained that its first response referred to its  program to monitor a new water source  in this case  the Flint river  for lead copper for two consecutive six   month  periods to determine optimal corrosion treatment  The report says there   s no reason to believe that DEQ willfully  misrepresented information to the EPA  It also concludes that ODWMA employees appeared to have notified    management properly about the unfolding Flint water situation     DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and Copper Rule  LCR  monitoring practices afterthe  switch to Flint water  but from past experience  DEQ believed it was doing so correctly by doing two rounds of six  month  monitoring on the new water source before determining optimal corrosion control  The EPA disagreed with DEQ s  interpretation ofthe LCR  but later stated that the LCR was open to interpretation  It then clarified the rule  the upshot   corrosion controls already in place when Flint was on Detroit water should have been maintained afterthe switch     DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start corrosion controls once the first round ofsix   month sampling results  arrived in late March 2015 and showed the water exceeded acceptable lead levels                    DEQ doesn   t oversee the Flint WTP so it doesn   t have any accountability measures to ensure the WTP is collecting water  samples from tier 1 homes  i e   residences with lead service lines  soldering or plumbing  Instead  DEQ relies on Flint s  certification of sample sites  The auditor suggests DEQ should consider an independent verification ofthe sampling pool  or Flint   s certifications  In November 2015  Flint admitted that it had no way to ensure the sites were all tier 1  Water  samples came from 175 randomly distributed testing bottles  DEQ has asked Fllnt to verify its prior samples by this  Wednesday  12 30      There   s been controversy that DEQ dropped two sampling sites with high lead levels from its second six month review  It  was appropriate for DEQ to do so because those sites did not meet federal criteria  It was also appropriate for DEQ to  require flushing taps the night before sampling to ensure faucets didn t contain overly stagnant water     Charts show that most water samples were taken in the sixth month of the six   month testing period  The report said its  tough to determine if the lateness ofthe sampling affects the accuracy     The report ends with an excellent timeline l have attached the report in case you want to review the timeline on page

percentile calculation report     During our review  we noted two potential improvements for the Flint WTP  sampling process  see Question 5 of the additional questions answered by the  OAG regarding tier 1 sample validity      DEQ could verify that the sampling pool was limited to only tier 1 sample    sites to ensure that the Flint WTP is in compliance with the LCR   Title 40  Part 141  section 86 a  3  of the Code of Federal Regulations     CF        DEQ could independently verify the validity of sample site certifications     What accountability measures are in place for ODWMA staff who fail to follow data    0 2   verification protocols     A  DEQ does not provide any direct oversight over the Flint WTP and  therefore     does not have any accountability measures over the Flint WTP s LCR data  verification protocols  DEQ s data verification protocol for lead and copper  water sampling is limited to verification that the WTP certifies samples  submitted to the State   owned laboratories for analysis  see steps 7 and 12 in  the Flint WTP LCR sampling process noted in Question 1 above   We did not  identify any instances in which ODWMA staff failed to verify that submitted    samples were certified by the Flint WTP     What accountability measures are in place for ODWMA staff who lie or  misrepresent information to the EPA     A  As with all classified employees  ODWMA staff must adhere to the rules and  regulations established by the Michigan Civil Service Commission  if any  ODWMA staff were determined to misrepresent information to the EPA  they  would be subject to Civil Service Rule 2   6  Discipline  which allows an  appointing authority to discipline an employee for just cause up to and including  dismissal  We are not aware of any DEQ   established measures that are in    addition to the Civil Service Rules     We gained access to the e   mail accounts of key DEQ management  DEQ  Director  Deputy Director  ODWMA Chief  and other key ODWMA staff   extending back to January 1  2013  We did so to identify the key decision  points and conversations that occurred leading up to and through the situation in  Flint  Our review was also intended to determine whether State  Flint  or other  officials attempted to conceal key test results or other information     We noted one email exchange between DEQ and the EPA that appears to be a  significant contributor to the concern that DEQ misrepresented information to  the EPA  The EPA requested clarification on February 26  2015 regarding the  type of optimized corrosion control treatment the Flint WTP was using  DEQ  responded on February 27  2015 that the city had an optimized corrosion  control program in place  but DEQ did not provide any program details  DEQ  informed usthat the Flint WTP corrosion control program included performing    Page 2    lead and copper monitoring for two consecutive six   month periods to determine  whether corrosion control treatment would be necessary in the future   However  it appears the EPA interpreted corrosion control program to mean that    corrosion control treatment was being performed     On April 23  2015  the EPA again inquired as to what the Flint WTP was doing  for corrosion control treatment  DEQ responded on April 24  2015 that the Flint    WTP was not practicing corrosion control treatment     Based on our review of this and other e mails  we have no specific reason to  believe that DEQ willfully misrepresented the information to the EPA     What policies do DEO  and ODWMA have in place to escalate major infractions up i    04   the chain of command   i    A  We did not note any instances of major infractions  i e   intentional disregard of  policies  laws  regulations or specific directions  committed by DEQ staff during      the course of our review  DEQ does not have a formal policy or procedure in 1  place to escalate major infractions performed by ODWMA employees  however   our review of DEQ correspondence confirmed the escalation of key issues up the  chain of command related to the Flint situation  DEQ stated that its informal  policy is for staff to notify the proper level of management of infractions to  i    determine necessary action            Page 3           OAG Additional Questions  Answered by the OAG    Of   ce ofthe Auditor General Wm M  A    _J    mini     m         m   w w   m mn   u       Application of the LCR    0 1     0 2     Q3     How did the Flint WTP become the primary water supplier for the City of Flint     A  Upon notification of the City of Flint    s plans to switch to the Karegnondi Water    Authority  KWA  in April 2013  the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department   DWSD  submitted a letter to the City of Flint stating that it would terminate its    agreement to provide water services on April 17  2014     According to DEQ management  the Flint WTP attempted to negotiate with the  DWSD to maintain it as the City of Flint water supplier  however  after  negotiations were unsuccessful  the City of Flint notified DEQ through a permit  request of its intent to operate the Flint WTP full time using the Flint River   Although the Flint City Council voted in March 2018 in support of moving to the  KWA pipeline  the vote was silent on the use of the Flint River as a temporary    drinking water source     DEQ informed us that in the 19903  the City of Flint upgraded the Flint WTP to  serve as a backup source of water for emergencies  In 2006  the Flint WTP  began quarterly testing of the treated Flint River water at the Flint WTP to  ensure water quality standards were met  however  the Flint WTP did not test  the water   s effect on the distribution system at consumer tap locations     Did DEO  consult with the EPA prior to determining how to apply the LCR     A  DEQ did not consult with the EPA on how to apply the LCR prior to  implementing two consecutive six   month monitoring periods of the Flint WTP  beginning July 1  2014  Based on past experiences applying the LCR monitoring  requirements  DEQ believed that it had appropriately applied the LCR    requirements of a large water system     When Flint switched to the Flint River water source  should corrosion control  treatment have been maintained     A  We believe that corrosion control treatment should have been maintained     According to the LCR  a water system can achieve optimized corrosion control if  it submits results of tap water monitoring for two consecutive six month  monitoring periods with acceptable lead levels  However  a water system that  has optimized corrosion control  and which has treatment in place  should  continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment     DEQ staff explained that they did not treat the switch to Flint River water as a  new system  but as a new source  DEQ further stated that because the Flint  River was a new water source and there was a change in chemicals needed to  treat the new source  a corrosion control study was needed to determine the  impact on the water distribution system  Therefore  it was DEQ s interpretation  that two rounds of six   month monitoring were still needed to evaluate the water    quality and determine optimal corrosion control treatment     Page 4         The Flint water system had optimal corrosion control treatment when the DWSD  WTP was the water supplier  Based on our review of notesfrom   a July 21   2015 EPA and DEQ conference call on DEQ s implementation of the LCR  regarding whether the Flint WTP should have continued to maintain corrosion  control treatment  it appeared that the EPA did not agree  with DEQ s  interpretation of the LCR  Region 5 EPA staff explained that they would talk to  the EPA headquarters about the interpretation of regulations and believes that  systems that have been deemed optimized need to  maintain  corrosion control   The Region agreed to provide supporting regulatory citations for the language    about maintaining corrosion control     On November 8  2015  the EPA issued a memorandum stating that the LCR had  differing possible interpretations  however  the EPA concluded that it is  important for large water systems to take the steps necessary to ensure that  appropriate corrosion control treatment is maintained at all times  thus ensuring  that public health is protected  Based on this clarification  it appears that  corrosion control treatment should have been maintained     Should DEO  have required the Flint WTP to start pursuing optimized corrosion  control treatment after the first round of six   month sampling results were above the    lead action level of 5 parts per billion  ppb        4     A  Yes  According to DEQ s application of the LCR  within six months after the  end of the monitoring period in which the water sample results exceeded the  acceptable lead level  DEQ should have required the Flint WTP to start pursuing    optimized corrosion control treatment     The LCR states that the lead action level is exceeded if the lead level  as  determined by the 90th percentile calculation  is greater than 15 ppb  if the  lead action level is exceeded  water systems are required to take additional  actions including educating the public about lead in drinking water as well as  commencing lead service line replacement if the water system has already  installed corrosion control and or source water treatment  However  for water  systems that have not yet implemented corrosion control treatment  they can be  deemed to have optimized corrosion control without installing treatment if they  can demonstrate lead levels below 5 ppb for two consecutive six month periods     The first round of six   month sampling results was received in late March 2015   Because the results were 1 ppb over the lead action level of 5 ppb  DEQ would  not be able to achieve two consecutive six month periods below 5 ppb   Therefore  DEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start pursuing optimized  corrosion control treatment  However  DEQ waited until the second round of  sampling was completed  June 30  2015  to assess whether water sample    results improved     Water Samples    05  Did DEQ verify that only tier 1 sample sites were selected by the Flint WTP in the    two rounds of six month samples     A  DEQ did not verify that only tier 1 sample sites were selected  DEQ relies on  the Flint WTP s certification of sample sites and does not perform any  independent verification of those certifications     Page 5    In a November 19  2015 Flint Journal article  the Flint WTP indicated that it did  not have the ability to ensure that all sites were tier 1  in fact  water samples  came from the random distribution of 175 testing bottles without regard for  whether the homes were at risk for high lead levels  DEQ issued a formal  memorandum on November 9  2015 requesting that the Flint WTP verify the  classification of all prior sample items  The results are due back from the Flint    WTP on December 30  2015     DEQ dropped two water sampling sites from its second six month sample   January 1  2015 through June 30  2015   Was this appropriate     A  Yes  it was appropriate for DEQ to drop these two water sampling sites  Federal    regulation 40 CFR 141 86ia  states            each water system shall complete a materials evaluation  of its distribution system in order to identify a pool of targeted  sampling sites that meets the requirements of this section        All sites from which first draw samples are collected shall be  selected from this pool       Sampling sites may not include  faucets that have point otuse or point of entry treatment  devices designed to remove inorganic contaminants      This regulation also requires that a water system s targeted sampling pool  consist of only tier 1 sampling sites if an adequate number is available to meet    monitoring requirements     According to federal regulation 40 CFR 141 86if   the State may invalidate a  water sample it it determines that the sample was taken from a site that did not  meet the site selection criteria  A sample invalidated per this regulation does  not count toward determining lead or copper 90th percentile levels or toward    meeting the minimum monitoring requirements     DEQ dropped one water sample site from its 90th percentile calculations  because the site was from a business that does not meet the tier 1 requirements  of being a single   family or multiple   family residence  The second sample site  was dropped because the home had a point   of entry treatment device to filter  contaminants  Based on the criteria specified above  it appears that DEQ   s  rationale for dropping the samples from these two sites appropriately met the  requirements for invalidating  samples per federal regulation 40 CFR 141 86     Was flushing of the taps the night before drawing a sample an appropriate sample  methodology     A  Yes  The LCR requires that samples be a first draw of water after six hours of  stagnation  The LCR does not indicate whether or not the water line should be  flushed prior to collecting the sample  in the sample instructions  DEQ required  proflushing to ensure that sampled faucets were not stagnant for an excessive  period of time beyond the targeted six hours  e g   rarely used faucets or when a  homeowner has been gone for an extended period of time      The LCR requires six hours of stagnation  however  it does not preclude DEQ  from instructing residents to flush prior to stagnation     Page 6                        V 0 AG Flint Wl P 2014 and 2015    Sample Locations  Exhibit  1     Olficc of tire Auditor General  m   Myrmummwm   m    unmassmw    In

devoted considerable  time and effmt to our review of the contamination of the Flint Water supply  Our focus has been on assessing  what happened  why it happened  and what is needed to prevent any recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in the  state  We have also  as you know  been assessing on going mitigation efforts     Attached is a letter reporting our    nding as to who bears the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint   We are sending this letter now because it has become clear to us that ascribing responsibility and ensuring  accountability is both critical and urgent  and simply cannot wait for our    nal report  Establishing responsibility  and accountability is the    rst step in re cstablishing the trust between the citizens of Flint and their government  and the agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health  The current level of distrust also serves to  compromise the effective delivery of protected services designed to address ongoing public health issues     Thank you for the support you have given us and your demonstrated commitment to respond to our    ndings and  recommendations     On behalf of the Task Force    Ken Sikkema    Ken Sikkema    Senior Policy Fellow  Public Sector Consultants  PH  517 484 4954  ksikkerna scinc coni              December 29  2015    Dear Governor Snyder     The Flint Water Advisory Task Force  which you appointed on October 21  2015  has devoted  considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply   what happened  why It occurred  and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in  the state  We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short  and long    term public health Issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the    health and well being ofthe Fllnt community     Shortly after we began our work  we recognized the immediate need for better coordination of the  state   s response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint  and for assignment of a single person to  provide this coordination  We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7  2015  and you  responded with Immediate adoption of these recommendations  We thank you for the commitment    your response demonstrates     in our continuing efforts  we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels   reviewed many documents  articles  and emails  and deliberated repeatedly as a group  Both individually  and as a group  we have visited Flint several times during the pastvseveral weeks to meet with citizens   public health officials and healthcare providers  individuals who have water management  responsibilities at the city and county levels  and other public officials     It is clear to us  particularly as we listen to the people of Flint  that it is both critical and urgent to  establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability  This is a  first step in a long process to re establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the  agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health  it is urgent because this deep distrust of  government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address  ongoing public health issues  It is forthese reasons that we are sending this letter at this time     We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department  of Environmental Quality  MDEQ   Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels  contributed to creating and prolonging the problem  MDEQ Is the government agency that has  responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan  It failed in that responsibility and must be    held accountable for that failure     The Safe Drinking Water Act  SDWA  places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the  public water system  In this instance  the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system  within SDWA requirements  under the jurisdiction ofthe MDEQ  The role ofthe MDEQ is to ensure  compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement    responsibility for the Flint water system     The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways     Regulatory Failure  We believe that in the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance  ODWMA  at MDEQ  a culture    exists in which  technical compliance  is considered sufficient to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan     This minimalist approach to regulatory and oversight responsibility is unacceptable and simply  insufficient to the task of public protection  It led to MDEQ   s failure to recognize a number of indications  that switching the water source in Flint would   and did   compromise both water safety and water  quality  The MDEQ made a number of decisions that were  and continue to be  justified on the basis that  federal rules  allowed    those decisions to be made  ODWMA must adopt a posture that Is driven not by  this minimalist technical compliance approach  but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be  done to assure drinking water safety     A culture change must occur within ODWMA  it must be driven by a mission that is aspirational  regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the safety and the quality of Michigan   s drinking water  We  believe  and have expressed to MDEQ Director Dan Wyant  that as a Great Lakes State  Michigan should  aspire to have the safest drinking water in the nation  rather than merely aiming for technical  compliance with regulatory requirements     Failure In Substance and Tone of MDEQ Response to the Public    Throughout 2015  as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted  and brought to the attention of MDEQ  the agency   s response was often one of aggressive dismissal   belittiement  and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved  We find both the tone  and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable  In a real way  the  MDEQ represents the public  including the very individuals it treated dismissively and disrespectfully in  public statements  We recognize that the agency might disagree with the opinions of others on a variety  of issues  including testing protocol  interpretation of testing results  the requirements of federal law  and rules  and other matters  What is disturbing about MDEQ   s responses  however  is their persistent  tone of scam and derision  In fact  the MDEQ seems to have been more determined to discredit the  work of others   who ultimately proved to be right   than to pursue its own oversight responsibility     Failure in MDEQ interpretation of the Lead and Copper Rule    The federal Lead and Copper Rule  LCR  is central to what happened in Flint  because that rule  at least  theoretically  is designed to prevent lead and copper contamination ofdrinking water  The federal LCR  calls for    optimized corrosion control treatment     which the MDEQ did not require in the switch to the  Flint River  Prior to the switch  MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion  control treatment  CCT  was not necessary until two six   month monitoring periods had been conducted   The need for CCI  would be evaluated after the results from those two monitoring periods were  reviewed  The decision not to require CCT  made at the direction ofthe MDEQ  led directly to the  contamination of the Flint water system     The MDEQseems to have taken different positions on whether it faithfully followed the LCR in the Flint  situation  ttfirst maintained that it followed the LCR  then stated that it did not follow the rule properly   and most recently claimed that a federal memorandum Issued by the US EPA in early November 2015  suggests that the original MDEQ interpretation was possibly correct     We are not convinced  Even the MDEQ   S latest interpretation ofthe US EPA   s November memorandum  is overly legalistic and misunderstands the intent of the LCR  which Is to minimize risks of lead and  copper exposure for human health     We believe ODWMA   s single   minded legalistic focus is the heart of the problem  and it is part of the     technical compliance  culture described above  ODWMA should not be basing its actions solely on a         legally possible Interpretation of the LCR  it should be focusing on how to protect Michigan   s citizens  from lead In drinking water     We met with MDEQ Director Wyant on December 16  2015  to discuss these issues  as well as many  others  We note his substantial agreement with many of our conclusions  particularly as it relates to the  regulatory failure and the abysmal public response of his agency  It Is our understanding that he has  drawn similar conclusions in his own evaluation ofthe MDEQ   s role in the Flint water crisis  At the same  time  it was disappointing to hear his weak defense of the CCT decision based on the EPA   s November    2015 memorandum     We are not finished with our work  Other individuals and entities made poor decisions  contributing to  and prolonging the contamination ofthe drinking water supply in Flint  As an example  we are  particularly concerned by recent revelations of MDHHS   s apparent early knowledge of  yet silence  about  elevated blood lead levels detected among Flint   s children  We also feel it important to further  review local government decision processes under emergency management  Our final report will  highlight and discuss those concerns  among many others  to provide some context to a comprehensive  series of recommendations  As stated earlier in this letter  however  we believe that establishing  responsibility is a critical and urgent need  and one that should not wait for our final report in 2016   individuals and agencies responsible must be held accountable in a timely fashion     it is our hope that the heightened awareness of the dangers of lead poisoning can be an opportunity to  make Michigan safer  particularly for its children  Drinking water must be recognized as a potential  source of health risk exposure when water lines and fixtures containing lead are disturbed or  compromised  Proper testing  not only in high   risk areas but also in facilities serving children  e g    schools   must he considered  Facilitating long   term financing of a model public health program  and  also replacement of lead   containing water service lines and fixtures  would enable Michigan to realize a  positive lasting legacy from the tragedy of the Flint water crisis  Our final report will address some of    these issues     The City of Flint s water customers   fellow Michigan citizens   were needlessly and tragically exposed to  toxic levels of lead through their drinking water supply  They deserve a commitment to properly assess  responsibility and ensure accountability  They also deserve a commitment to needed mitigation in both  the short and long term  The Flint water crisis never should have happened  Having failed to prevent it   state government should coordinate a sustained  public health focused response to remedy  to the    fullest extent possible  the impacts on the Flint community     Respectfully yours     Flint Water Advisory Task Force     Matt Davis

michigan gov   Subject  Flint letter    Governor     Attached is a letter from the Flint Water Task Force which will be formally sent to you tomorrow  The Task  Force then plans to release this letter publicly on Wednesday morning     You will see the letter is harsh against DEQ     Rich  Redford  Harvey  Maegan  and myself all just gathered on a conference call to discuss our upcoming  actions regarding Flint  While we don   t think this letter should change any of our actions  we agreed we may    need to accelerate some of the structural changes at DEQ     Our suggestions     1  Make structural changes at DEQ as early as tomorrow  The recommendations in this letter suggest  profound change at DEQ and openly criticize Director Wyant  If this is the path that the Task Force is on  it is  best to make changes at DEQ sooner rather than later  That likely means accepting Dan s resignation  It also  means moving up the termination of the 3 DEQ personal previously planned for J an 4 to tomorrow     2  Still do statement tomorrow from you regarding Flint  This statement will be slightly revised by Maegan  to acknowledge we received feedback from the Task Force and reiterate that we created the Task Force with the  intent of getting honest independent feedback  More impmtantly  if we are making changes at DEQ  they can    also be announced in the statement      If you have amoment  it is probably best that Rich 8c I discuss with you over the phone tomorrow  moming  But I wanted to get you some of our thinking tonight     Let me know if there is a good time to discuss tomorrow     Thanks  J arrod         Dear Governor Snyder     The Flint Water Advisory Task Force  which you appointed on October 21  2015  has devoted  considerable effort and countless hours to our review of the contamination of the Flint water supply   what happened  why it occurred  and what is needed to prevent a recurrence in Flint or elsewhere in  the state  We have also been assessing ongoing mitigation efforts to help assure that short    and long   term public health issues and water management concerns will be properly addressed to safeguard the  health and well being of the Flint community         Shortly after we began our work  we recognized the immediate need for better coordination ofthe  state   s response to the ongoing public health issues in Flint  and for assignment of a single person to  provide this coordination  We addressed these concerns in a letter to you on December 7  2015  and you  responded with immediate adoption ofthese recommendations  We thank you for the commitment    your response demonstrates     In our continuing efforts  we have now interviewed numerous individuals at state and local levels   reviewed many documents  articles  and emails  and deliberated repeatedly as a group  Both individually  and as a group  we have visited Flint several times during the past several weeks to meet with citizens   public health officials and healthcare providersxindividuals who have water management  responsibilities at the city and county levels  and other public officials     It is clear to us  particularly as we listen to the people of Flint  that it is both critical and urgent to  establish responsibility for what happened in their community and to ensure accountability  This is a  first step in a long process to re establish the trust they no longer have in their government and the  agencies whose responsibility it is to protect their health  It is urgent because this deep distrust of  government continues to compromise the effective delivery of protective services designed to address  ongoing public health issues  It is for these reasons that we are sending this letter at this time     We believe the primary responsibility for what happened in Flint rests with the Michigan Department  of Environmental Quality  MDEQ   Although many individuals and entities at state and local levels  contributed to creating and prolonging the problem  MDEQ is the government agency that has  responsibility to ensure safe drinking water in Michigan  it failed in that responsibility and must be  held accountable for that failure     The Safe Drinking Water Act  SDWA  places responsibility for compliance with its requirements on the  public water system  In this instance  the City of Flint had the responsibility to operate its water system  within SDWA requirements  underthe jurisdiction ofthe MDEQ     The role ofthe MDEQ is to ensure  compliance with the SDWA through its regulatory oversight as the primary agency having enforcement  responsibility for the Flint watersystem     The MDEQ failed in three fundamental ways     Regulatory Failure    We believe that in the Office of Drinking

that  federal rules  allowed  those decisions to be made  ODWMA must adopt a posture that is driven not by  this minimalist technical compliance approach  but rather by one that is founded on what needs to be  done to assure drlnlring water safety     A culture change must occur within ODWMA  It must be driven by a mission that is aspirational  regarding the role of the MDEQ in ensuring the
